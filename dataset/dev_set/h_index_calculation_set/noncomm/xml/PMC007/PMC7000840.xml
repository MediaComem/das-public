We report the first pediatric case, in a patient in whom a sustained remission was induced by rituximab as add-on to a short course of cyclophosphamide as first-line treatment.</p></sec><sec id="sec2"><title>Case Report</title><p id="p0020">A 15-year-old girl with no relevant medical history presented at the outpatient clinic with shortness of breath, cough, and left-sided thoracic pain. Two weeks prior to the presentation, she had symptoms consistent with a mild upper respiratory infection with hemorrhagic blisters on the right elbow and heel as well as the left toe. The review of systems was entirely negative. The patient used oral contraception but no other drugs; she had no history of smoking or illicit drug use. The results of a physical examination were normal. Laboratory investigations showed normal blood counts, C-reactive protein level of 62 mg/l, and D-dimer of 7900 ng/ml. Computed tomographic angiography of the chest showed no vascular abnormalities, although parenchymal consolidations were found in the upper lobes and right lower lobe of the lungs. The patient was admitted, and amoxicillin/clavulanic acid and analgesics were started. New painful hemorrhagic blisters and bloody stools, however, developed.</p><p id="p0025">At day 7, the patient became oliguric, and serum creatinine increased from 57 &#x003bc;mol/l to 96 &#x003bc;mol/l. Nonnephrotic proteinuria and red cell casts on urinalysis were found. Systolic and diastolic blood pressures were within the 96th and 79th percentiles, respectively. The kidneys appeared normal on ultrasound, and a diagnosis of rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis was inferred. A kidney biopsy sample showed 11 glomeruli without global sclerosis. Seven glomeruli (64%) showed breaks of the glomerular basement membrane associated with fibrinoid necrosis, karyorrhexis, and cellular crescents, whereas the other glomeruli appeared normal. Interstitial fibrosis, tubular atrophy, and vascular damage were not present, underlining the acute onset of disease. Immunofluorescence microscopy revealed linear deposits of polyclonal IgG and C3c along the GBM (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;1</xref>). Indeed, circulating anti-GBM Abs (258 U/ml; reference value,&#x000a0;&#x0003c;7 U/ml) and MPO-ANCA (25 IU/ml; reference value,&#x000a0;&#x0003c;3.5 IU/ml), confirmed by capture enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, were detected. Thus, a diagnosis of SVV linked to double positivity was made, with pulmonary and renal involvement.<fig id="fig1"><label>Figure&#x000a0;1</label><caption><p>Kidney biopsy findings. (a) Breaks of the glomerular basement membrane can be appreciated with fibrinoid necrosis and crescent formation on light microscopy (Jones methenamine silver, original magnification&#x000a0;&#x000d7;400).

Methylprednisolone (1000 mg/d for 3 days), prednisolone (60 mg/d tapered over 5 months), cyclophosphamide (150 mg/d for 6 weeks), and rituximab (1000 mg twice) also were started (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;2</xref>). Six months after the last dose of rituximab, CD19<sup>+</sup> B lymphocytes reappeared.<fig id="fig2"><label>Figure&#x000a0;2</label><caption><p>Treatment and follow-up.

Nonnephrotic proteinuria (500&#x02212;1000 mg/d), however, persisted. Focal global glomerulosclerosis (n/N&#x000a0;= 8/36 glomeruli) and fibrotic crescents (n/N&#x000a0;= 5/36 glomeruli) were found on repeat kidney biopsy, reflecting structural abnormalities; no significant damage was seen in the tubulointerstitial and vascular compartments. Linear deposits of polyclonal IgG and IgM, however, remained present. Thus, chronic glomerular damage was found with no disease activity. Indeed, neither anti-GBM Abs nor MPO-ANCA have reoccurred since, and the patient&#x02019;s renal function has improved to an estimated glomerular filtration rate of &#x0003e;90 ml/min per 1.73 m<sup>2</sup>. Amenorrhea did not develop.</p></sec><sec id="sec3"><title>Discussion</title><p id="p0040">We present the first pediatric case of SVV that developed on the background of anti-GBM Abs and MPO-ANCA, in a patient in whom a sustained remission was achieved upon Abs depletion and rituximab in addition to a short course of cyclophosphamide as first-line treatment.</p><p id="p0045">SVV related to ANCA is extremely rare among children (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>), with an estimated incidence of&#x000a0;&#x0003c;1&#x000a0;per 100,000 children per year.<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr"><sup>7</sup></xref> In the adult population, up to 10% of cases with SVV related to ANCA present with coexisting anti-GBM Abs<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr"><sup>2</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr"><sup>3</sup></xref>; to date, double positivity also has been described in 6 pediatric cases (<xref rid="appsec1" ref-type="sec">Supplementary Table&#x000a0;S1</xref>).

It has been postulated that patients with double positivity have smoldering glomerular inflammation related to ANCA, inducing a conformational change of the Goodpasture antigen, anti-GBM Abs formation via epitope spreading,<xref rid="appsec1" ref-type="sec">S1</xref> and fulminant SVV. Pathologic studies underline this hypothesis, as various stages of disease can be found on kidney tissue sections from patients with double positivity. In contrast, synchronous crescent formation can be found in most cases of pure anti-GBM disease.<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr"><sup>2</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr"><sup>3</sup></xref></p><p id="p0055">The patient&#x02019;s kidney biopsy showed necrotizing crescentic glomerulonephritis with no evidence of chronic damage in the tubulointerstitial and vascular compartments, indicating early disease.

Patients with double positivity therefore require maintenance treatment, in contrast to those with pure anti-GBM disease, who have a low risk of relapse. Rituximab can be used for remission maintenance following sustained remission in SVV related to ANCA, although the optimal use has to be established yet. Monitoring of ANCA levels and circulating CD19<sup>+</sup> B lymphocytes may guide rituximab treatment.<xref rid="appsec1" ref-type="sec">S6</xref> The patient&#x02019;s CD19<sup>+</sup> B lymphocytes reappeared after 6 months, whereas ANCA test results remained negative, indicating quiescent immunologic disease. Furthermore, negative ANCA test results after the induction of a sustained remission and initial MPO specificity have been linked to a lower risk of relapse. Rituximab has therefore not been reinfused.</p><p id="p0065">In conclusion, SVV and double positivity are extremely rare in the pediatric population and warrant immunosuppressive treatment. Rituximab appeared safe and may be used as add-on treatment for remission induction. Future trials therefore should focus on rituximab for the treatment of SVV linked to double positivity. CD19<sup>+</sup> B lymphocytes and Abs levels may guide maintenance treatment.</p></sec><sec id="sec4"><title>Disclosure</title><p id="p0070">All the authors declared no competing
