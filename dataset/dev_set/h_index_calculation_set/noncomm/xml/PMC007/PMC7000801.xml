While many people with gambling concerns might benefit from help, the large majority do not access treatment (<xref rid="bb0020" ref-type="bibr">Cunningham, 2005</xref>; <xref rid="bb0205" ref-type="bibr">Slutske, 2006</xref>; <xref rid="bb0215" ref-type="bibr">Suurvali et al., 2008</xref>). There are several possible reasons for this, including a lack of treatment availability, concerns about stigma, a lack of problem recognition, and the perception of a poor match between treatments that are offered and what the person wants (<xref rid="bb0220" ref-type="bibr">Suurvali et al., 2009</xref>). However, many people with gambling concerns who do not access face-to-face treatment are interested in other means of receiving assistance (<xref rid="bb0030" ref-type="bibr">Cunningham et al., 2008</xref>). Further, other options for accessing care are available, including written self-help materials (<xref rid="bb0005" ref-type="bibr">Abbott et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="bb0145" ref-type="bibr">Hodgins et al., 2004</xref>; <xref rid="bb0150" ref-type="bibr">Hodgins et al., 2009</xref>; <xref rid="bb0140" ref-type="bibr">Hodgins et al., 2001</xref>), helplines (<xref rid="bb0100" ref-type="bibr">Ferland et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="bb0165" ref-type="bibr">Kim et al., 2016</xref>), and a growing range of Internet-based interventions (<xref rid="bb0060" ref-type="bibr">Cunningham, Godinho et al., 2019a</xref>; <xref rid="bb0065" ref-type="bibr">Cunningham, Hodgins et al., 2019</xref>; <xref rid="bb0155" ref-type="bibr">Hodgins et al., 2019</xref>; <xref rid="bb0175" ref-type="bibr">van der Maas et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p id="p0025">An additional challenge to providing help to those with gambling concerns is that gambling problems often do not occur in isolation. Mental health distress is common among people with disordered gambling, as are the experience of other addictive behaviours (<xref rid="bb0015" ref-type="bibr">Bischof et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="bb0075" ref-type="bibr">Desai and Potenza, 2008</xref>; <xref rid="bb0160" ref-type="bibr">Kessler et al., 2008</xref>; <xref rid="bb0170" ref-type="bibr">Lorains et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="bb0180" ref-type="bibr">Martin et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="bb0190" ref-type="bibr">Petry et al., 2005</xref>). While there is an emerging literature on whether there are benefits associated with providing assistance for other mental health concerns and/or other addictions alongside care for gambling concerns (<xref rid="bb0095" ref-type="bibr">Dowling et al., 2016</xref>; <xref rid="bb0115" ref-type="bibr">Geisner et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="bb0130" ref-type="bibr">Hodgins and el-Guebaly, 2010</xref>; <xref rid="bb0210" ref-type="bibr">Stea and Hodgins, 2011</xref>; <xref rid="bb0230" ref-type="bibr">Toneatto and Ladouceur, 2003</xref>; <xref rid="bb0245" ref-type="bibr">Wynn et al., 2014</xref>), this area is still in its infancy (<xref rid="bb0250" ref-type="bibr">Yakovenko and Hodgins, 2018</xref>). In the domain of assisted self-change for gambling (i.e., self-help books, internet interventions), there is little or no published literature to-date on interventions specific to concurrent disorders (<xref rid="bb0060" ref-type="bibr">Cunningham, Godinho, et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p id="p0030">This project is the second of two randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to examine the potential benefits of combining online help for gambling with assistance for mental health or addictions concerns (<xref rid="bb0045" ref-type="bibr">Cunningham et al., 2016</xref>; <xref rid="bb0055" ref-type="bibr">Cunningham et al., 2018</xref>). In the first study, participants who gambled in a risky fashion were randomized to receive either just a gambling online intervention or the gambling intervention plus a research validated intervention for depression (MoodGYM) (<xref rid="bb0065" ref-type="bibr">Cunningham, Hodgins et al., 2019</xref>). All participants displayed reductions in severity of gambling from baseline to follow-up. In addition, there were significant reductions in mental health distress. However, these reductions were not significantly different (p&#x000a0;&#x0003e;&#x000a0;.05) between those who were provided access to MoodGYM and those who were not. Challenges with the study included a limited use of both interventions (but particularly only a very limited use of MoodGYM). In addition, about three-quarters of participants displayed levels of mental health distress at baseline that were indicative of current depression or anxiety, making it challenging to explore any impact of adding MoodGYM to participants who did not have co-occurring gambling and mental health concerns. It was concluded that, while many people seeking access to online interventions for gambling might be experiencing mental health distress, there did not appear to be any added benefit to providing access to a mental health intervention (such as MoodGYM) alongside a gambling intervention (<xref rid="bb0065" ref-type="bibr">Cunningham, Hodgins et al. 2019</xref>).</p><p id="p0035">The current trial used the same methods to examine whether there was any benefit to adding a brief online intervention for unhealthy alcohol use to an online intervention for gambling. Unhealthy alcohol use was targeted because these issues frequently co-occur (<xref rid="bb0070" ref-type="bibr">Cunningham-Williams et al., 1998</xref>; <xref rid="bb0190" ref-type="bibr">Petry et al., 2005</xref>), and because heavy alcohol consumption and gambling problems may be functionally interrelated among those who engage in both behaviours (<xref rid="bb0010" ref-type="bibr">Barnes et al., 2015</xref>; <xref rid="bb0120" ref-type="bibr">el-Guebaly et al., 2006</xref>; <xref rid="bb0160" ref-type="bibr">Kessler et al., 2008</xref>; <xref rid="bb0185" ref-type="bibr">Martins et al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="bb0190" ref-type="bibr">Petry et al., 2005</xref>; <xref rid="bb0235" ref-type="bibr">Welte et al., 2015</xref>).

Briefly, potential participants were recruited from across Canada using online advertisements asking for people who were &#x0201c;concerned about your gambling? Study includes online help for your gambling.&#x0201d; The advertisement also stated that this was a research study and not a treatment program and that compensation would be provided. As with the first study (examining the combination of online gambling and mental health interventions), the recruitment of participants for the trial required a varied and sustained set of online advertisements placed on several different platforms (e.g. Facebook, Google AdWords, Kijiji) and targeting all of Canada. In addition, print and radio advertisements were placed in Manitoba (the primary target population). After reading a brief description of the study, participants completed an eligibility screener to identify those who were 18&#x000a0;years or older and who scored 3 or more on the Problem Gambling Severity Index (PGSI) (<xref rid="bb0105" ref-type="bibr">Ferris and Wynne, 2001</xref>). Participants who were found eligible provided their email address and were sent a link to an online consent form that described the study in more detail. No mention of the brief alcohol intervention was made during the advertisement or consent component of the trial recruitment (on the consent form, potential participants were informed that they would be accessing a website that provided help to gamblers and that not everyone would receive access to the same website). Those interested were asked to provide their postal address and telephone contact information. Research staff then manually checked the postal address of each potential participant to confirm that it was a real address and that no other person from the same address had already registered for the trial. This postal address check was intended to promote the chances of having only genuine participants registered for the trial (as opposed to those interested in payment and gaining multiple registrations) and to reduce the chances of contamination between experimental conditions. In addition, the postal address check was an attempt to improve the poor follow-up rate obtained in the previous trial (where only 47.2% completed at least one follow-up).</p></sec><sec id="s0020"><label>2.2</label><title>Randomization, experimental conditions</title><p id="p0060">Participants who passed the postal address check were emailed a link to the baseline survey. On completion of the survey, prospective participants were asked to log into the intervention portal. Those who logged into the portal were randomized to one of two groups (1:1 ratio) and provided access to the respective intervention for the entire duration of the study. Randomization was automated and stratified by participant sex, age group, and prior use of treatment for gambling problems. To encourage intervention usage, participants also received up to 2 reminders to log into the study intervention website. Participants were then followed-up at 3 and 6&#x000a0;months, post baseline, to assess changes in amount of gambling and level of mental health distress and were provided 30&#x000a0;days to complete the questionnaire before it expired. Participants were provided with a $10 gift certificate from Amazon.ca on completion of the baseline survey (to promote retention at this stage) and with a $20 and a $30 gift certificate for completing each of the 3- and 6-month follow-ups respectively.</p><sec id="s0025"><label>2.2.1</label><title>Intervention groups</title><sec id="s0030"><label>2.2.1.1</label><title>Gambling intervention only (G-only)</title><p id="p0065">The G-only online intervention consisted of a study specific version of the self-change booklets developed by Hodgins et al.

As with the paper version, the online intervention provides the user with behavioural and cognitive strategies to promote reductions in gambling (<xref rid="bb0155" ref-type="bibr">Hodgins et al., 2019</xref>). These strategies are divided into 4 different modules which users can complete at their own pace, in any order and as many times as they would like: (1) Self-assessment, (2) Making your decision (i.e. goal setting activities), (3) Reaching your goal (i.e. understanding how thinking patterns affect gambling), and (4) Maintaining your goal (i.e. relapse prevention strategies).</p></sec><sec id="s0035"><label>2.2.1.2</label><title>Gambling plus alcohol intervention (G&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;A)</title><p id="p0070">Participants assigned to the G&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;A intervention were provided with the same online gambling intervention.

Unhealthy alcohol use was common, with 41.1% scoring 8 or more on the AUDIT. Follow-up rates were good, with 80.1% at 3-month and 84.0% at 6-month follow-up.

In both trials, participants were recruited using an advertisement asking for people who were concerned about their gambling but made no mention of the provision of additional online help beyond that provided for gambling concerns. In both trials, participants reported reductions in gambling over time. In the current trial, there was no observed reduction in alcohol consumption, irrespective of whether the participant was provided access to only the gambling intervention or to both the gambling and alcohol interventions. In the previous trial, there were significant improvements in mental health status but this did not appear to be related to whether the participants actually received the mental health intervention (<xref rid="bb0065" ref-type="bibr">Cunningham, Hodgins et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p id="p0130">While the observed reductions in gambling may be due to provision of the online gambling intervention, this claim cannot be made from the current (or previous) trial because all participants were provided with the online gambling intervention (and testing the efficacy of the gambling intervention was not the purpose of these trials). The intervention itself has shown efficacy in a paper and pencil format (<xref rid="bb0005" ref-type="bibr">Abbott et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="bb0150" ref-type="bibr">Hodgins et al., 2009</xref>; <xref rid="bb0140" ref-type="bibr">Hodgins et al., 2001</xref>). However, the online version has not demonstrated efficacy, as of yet, compared to a randomly assigned control group (<xref rid="bb0060" ref-type="bibr">Cunningham, Godinho, et al., 2019</xref>; <xref rid="bb0155" ref-type="bibr">Hodgins et al., 2019</xref>). In the current trial, there appeared to be more use of the gambling modules than our previous study (combining gambling and mental health online interventions). However, extent of use was still fairly limited, with roughly a quarter of participants completing two of the four modules. If it is assumed that participants who complete the intervention will gain the most benefit, then more work is needed to find ways to promote engagement with the intervention. This issue is not unique to the current intervention as lack of engagement with online interventions and, indeed, face-to-face interventions appear to be the norm rather than the exception (<xref rid="bb0195" ref-type="bibr">Ryan et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p id="p0135">The current trial had good follow-up rates and showed a substantial improvement over the previous trial, which employed the same recruitment advertisements (80.1% and 84.0% at 3 and 6&#x000a0;months compared to 38.8% and 34.1% respectively in the previous trial). While it is possible that participants recruited after an extended period of advertising (i.e., after recruitment was completed for the first trial) are more likely to complete a follow-up than those recruited early in an advertising campaign, the more likely reason for this improved retention rate was our revised intake procedure. In our first trial, we only collected participants&#x02019; email addresses as a means of contact. In the current trial, we collected participants&#x02019; postal address and telephone numbers in addition to an email address. Further, the postal mail address was checked to establish that it was a real address (and that no occurrences of the same address had been provided). It is probable that this resulted in fewer participants who were not committed to take part in the research (in addition to reducing the number of people who registered for the trial multiple times). Finally, an additional $10 gift certificate was provided at the completion of the baseline survey to encourage retention at this time point.</p><p id="p0140">The current trial observed no significant (p&#x000a0;&#x0003e;&#x000a0;.05) reductions in alcohol consumption in either condition. This suggests that the addition of a brief alcohol intervention to an online gambling intervention may not be merited as a means to reduce unhealthy alcohol use or to improve gambling outcomes. However, it is important to be clear that this tentative conclusion only applies to the situation where people concerned about their gambling are seeking help for their gambling but have not sought help for other concerns simultaneously (such as unhealthy drinking). This recruitment approach results in a relevant context within which to examine the benefits of combining gambling and alcohol online interventions because it mimics the way that many people looking for help online for their gambling will most likely approach a website. However, there are other pertinent questions to ask of the benefits of combining gambling and alcohol online interventions. One such question would be what the best way to provide online help is for participants who are concerned about both their gambling and their unhealthy alcohol use (rather than people who are concerned about their gambling and who drink in an unhealthy fashion but may or may not be concerned about their drinking). In such a situation, the researcher might instead recruit participants using an advertisement asking for people who are concerned about both their gambling and their drinking. This subgroup of problem gamblers might indeed reduce their alcohol consumption (and show greater improvements in their gambling) when presented with both problem gambling and unhealthy alcohol consumption interventions. However, many participants with unhealthy alcohol use would most likely not respond to an advertisement asking for people who are concerned about both gambling and alcohol use because they may not be concerned about their drinking, or may decide to address their concerns separately (&#x02018;I&#x02019;ll deal with my gambling then get to my drinking&#x02019;), or may assume that the researcher is only interested in people who drink a lot more than they do. Notable in the current trial was that, while almost half of participants met criteria for unhealthy alcohol use were regarded as meriting a brief alcohol intervention, the alcohol consumption of many of these participants was less severe than would be expected in a treatment-seeking sample. However, the personalized feedback intervention provided was largely designed for people with unhealthy, but not severe, levels of alcohol consumption. Thus, there is likely some other reason that no significant reductions in alcohol use were observed among the participants in this trial meeting criteria for unhealthy drinking than some sort of floor effect due to low levels of alcohol consumption at baseline.</p><p id="p0145">There were a number of limits to the current trial, some of which have already been mentioned. The lack of engagement with the online intervention is troubling and points to the need to find ways to make continued use of the intervention more attractive. However, it is important to note that intervention engagement may not be separable from the intervention content, the target behavior, and/or the mechanisms of action within the intervention. Second, while there is research indicating that self-report of amount of gambling is generally reliable, it would be a strength if some other objective measure of gambling could be obtained (and ideally to do this without changing the composition of the participants in the trial). Finally, the brief alcohol personalized feedback intervention employed in the current trial was a stand-alone intervention rather than one that had been integrated into the online gambling intervention. One topic for future research in this area would be the benefits of a more integrated intervention (e.g., one that contained information on how increased levels of intoxication might promote gambling losses &#x02013; or how gambling losses might promote unhealthy alcohol consumption) on improvements in gambling and reduction in unhealthy alcohol use.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list
