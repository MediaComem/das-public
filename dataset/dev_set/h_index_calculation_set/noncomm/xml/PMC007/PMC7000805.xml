Pellets containing Phytic acid, 5- Fluorouracil (5-FU), Microcrystalline cellulose (MCC) PH 101, Hydroxypropyl Methylcellulose (HPMC) and Barium sulfate were prepared by using extrusion spheronization technique. Prepared pellets were coated with Eudragit S100 to achieve colon-specific drug delivery. Pellets were characterized for various pharmaceutical and micromeritic attributes. The in vivo therapeutic efficacy comprising of both pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic parameters was determined in Ehrlich ascites carcinoma (EAC) induced cancer animal model. Phytic acid and 5-FU combinations seem to exert higher cytotoxic activity via increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) level by chelating manganese. Further pharmacokinetic studies reveled approximately 50% lower C<sub>max</sub> in the finished formulation, indicates lower systemic exposure to the drug. X-ray radiography ensures the localized delivery of the encapsulated drug. Histopathological studies indicated no significant local toxicity compared to the uncoated formulation. Results inferred that the proposed combination has superior anticancer activity with minimum systemic and local toxicity and it opens a new avenue in the treatment of colorectal cancer.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="teaser" id="abs0015"><p>Materials science; Pharmaceutical science; Controlled drug delivery; 5-flurouracil; Phytic acid; Colon cancer; Pellets</p></abstract><kwd-group id="kwrds0010"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Materials science</kwd><kwd>Pharmaceutical science</kwd><kwd>Controlled drug delivery</kwd><kwd>5-flurouracil</kwd><kwd>Phytic acid</kwd><kwd>Colon cancer</kwd><kwd>Pellets</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="sec1"><label>1</label><title>Introduction</title><p id="p0010">The incidences of colorectal cancer (CRC) have increased rapidly in young patients. Further, drinking alcohol increases the risk of developing CRC (<xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">Vuik et&#x000a0;al., 2019</xref>). The second leading cause of death responsible all over the world is cancer, accounting for 8.9 million deaths globally per year (<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">Fitzmaurice et&#x000a0;al., 2018</xref>). 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) has been widely used as oral chemotherapy for early and advanced CRC. Although 5-FU presents to be a promising drug for CRC however, short elimination half-life requires multiple administration, limits the therapeutic potential of the drug (<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">Alibolandi et&#x000a0;al., 2017</xref>). Multiple administration of 5-FU increases the risk of chemotherapy toxicity and resistance. Colon-specific sustained drug delivery system improves the efficacy and safety of the drug. Further sustained-release minimizes the risk of drug plasma fluctuation and reduced systemic toxicity (<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">Sreelatha and Brahma, 2013</xref>). Therefore, specific Eudragit&#x000ae; acrylic polymers have been developed for peroral dosage forms with the step-wise release of active ingredients in the digestive tract (<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">Amidon et&#x000a0;al., 2015</xref>). Eudragit&#x000ae; coatings get dissolved as a function of environmental pH and release of active ingredients occurs near the colon in a pH range 6.5&#x02013;7.5. Eudragit S 100 has been extensively used as a pH-sensitive polymer for colon drug targeting (<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">Wairkar and Gaud, 2016</xref>). In the current study, we have formulated Eudragit S100 coated pellets to achieve colon-specific sustained drug delivery system. Superoxide dismutase (SOD) is a critical enzyme responsible for the elimination of superoxide radicals and is considered to be a key anti-oxidant in aerobic cells (<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">Hwang et&#x000a0;al., 2007</xref>). Reactive oxygen species (ROS) production including the superoxide radicals (o<sub>2</sub><sup><bold>.</bold>-</sup>) and hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) occurs when oxygen is taken up by cells for oxidative phosphorylation during ATP (adenosine triphosphate) generation in mitochondria. Accumulation of ROS results in cellular oxidative stress and if not corrected, can lead to damage of important biomolecules such as membrane lipids, proteins, and DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid). Prolonged accumulation of high levels of free radicals in cells may cause irreversible cellular injury and ultimately results in cell death. Since SOD is the key enzyme involved in the management of free radicals (<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">Hileman et&#x000a0;al., 2001</xref>), silencing of SOD causes increased accumulation of O<sub>2</sub><sup><bold>. -</bold></sup>subsequently lead to cell death. Thus, silencing of SOD might offer a promising alternative to kill cancer cells (<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">Birben et&#x000a0;al., 2012</xref>). SODs are the most important antioxidant defense systems against O<sub>2</sub><sup><bold>. -</bold></sup>, that incorporates three isoforms of SOD in mammals (<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">Perry et&#x000a0;al., 2010</xref>): the cytoplasmic Cu/ZnSOD (SOD1), the mitochondrial MnSOD (SOD2), and the extracellular Cu/ZnSOD (SOD3). All isoforms need catalytic metal (Cu or Mn) for their activation. Cancer cells usually express high level of antioxidant enzymes to protect cells from ROS. It has been reported that colon cancer has elevated levels of MnSOD. Chelating agents are capable of binding to free metal ions, thereby makes them unavailable for enzyme activity (<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">Borrelli et&#x000a0;al., 2014</xref>). Inactivation of SOD increases the level of ROS, which leads to cell lysis. Cui et&#x000a0;al., reported that copper chelates penicillamine enhances the level of intrinsic oxidative stress in variety of cancers, leading to cell lysis (<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">Cui et&#x000a0;al., 2005</xref>).</p><p id="p0015">Phytic acid (myoinositol-hexaphosphate, IP6) is a constituent of dietary fiber in cereals. It has a high capacity to form insoluble complexes (phytates) with divalent metal ions present in food (<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">Persson et&#x000a0;al., 1998</xref>). The relative order of metal chelation with phytic acid at pH 7.4 was found to be Cu2+&#x0003e;Zn2+&#x0003e;Co2+&#x0003e;Mn2+&#x0003e;Fe2+&#x0003e;Ca2+ (<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">Reddy et&#x000a0;al., 1982</xref>). Phytic acid supplementation is known to exhibit anti-cancer, anti-inflammatory and antioxidant activity, therefore, metal chelates are of considerable interest to improve the anticancer activity of chemotherapeutic drugs in combination or alone (<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">Narayanaswamy and Mohd, 2018</xref>). Accordingly, the present study focused on investigating the therapeutic potential of combination strategies (phytic acid with 5-FU) to treat cancer in xenograft animal model.</p><p id="p0020">In addition to the above, the proposed formulation consists of a contrast agent, barium sulfate to track the drug carrier in the gastrointestinal tract. In the present study, we have formulated Eudragit coated pellets containing phytic acid, 5-FU and barium sulfate using extrusion spheronization technique. Critical formulation parameters like weight ratio of coating polymer, 5-FU, Hydroxypropyl methylcellulose and process parameters including spheronizer speed and time were optimized. Selected critical attributes should perform an effect on the morphology of pellets. X-ray radiography of the treated animals was performed to establish the targeting potential of the formulation. Plasma drug distribution and histopathology studies were performed to access the toxicological outcomes of the optimized formulation. Tumor regression study was performed to measure the therapeutic efficacy of the prepared system in Ehrlich ascites carcinoma (EAC) induces cancer model in Wistar rats.</p></sec><sec id="sec2"><label>2</label><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="sec2.1"><label>2.1</label><title>Materials</title><p id="p0025">The following materials were used to prepare the formulations: The drug 5-FU was obtained from the United Biotech Pvt.

In this study, the collective level of formulation variables, rotation speed &#x00026; rotation time of spheronization and extrusion conditions was required to produce 5-FU loaded pellets with desirable pharmaceutical properties (% highest yield, optimum moisture content and lowest pellet size). At the initial stage, the concentration of binder, water and bulking agent were optimized under a define extrusion spheronization parameters (rotation speed and time). Results show that as the concentration of HPMC decreases from 10.5% to 5% w/w against a fixed concentration of MCC, it affects the pellet morphology and percentage yield. However, percent yield was found to decrease with an increase in MCC concentration. Further, the higher water content increases inter particular attractive force which is enough to cause the spheronization of pellets with decreasing particle size. From the results, 5% w/w concentration of binder was taken forward for further optimization. Keeping the binder concentration constant then MCC concentration was optimized. MCC concentration at 47.8% w/w has shown the highest product yield with optimum moisture content and lowest pellet size. As the MCC concentration was increased further, there was a decrease in % yield with an increase in particle size. 47.8% w/w percentage of MCC considered optimized and taken forward for further optimization. Further, the formulation was screened for the water level on the basis of pellets size and shape keeping the concentration of binder and bulking agent constant. Results suggested that the pellet size was significantly reduced above a total water level of 43.4% w/v. Further, the formulation was screened for rotation speed and time for spheronization.

This was followed by the approximated zero-order release of the formulated system because that shows a steady drug release due to pH-dependent drug release behavior of Eudragit S 100. Due to the pH-sensitive nature of polymer used to coat the formulation the rate of drug release depends on the swelling of Eudragit S100 in an alkaline pH 7.4 (Pundlikrao P. et&#x000a0;al., 2017).

The study further highlights inhibiting redox enzymes, which could be an effective strategy to break the defense mechanism of cancer cells, leading to improve therapeutic activity. Delivery of anticancer drugs using pH-sensitive polymer, ensure high local drug concentration to achieve selective cytotoxic activity and also minimizes systemic exposure of drug, could help to reduce the risk of drug dependent systemic toxicity. The present studies open a new avenue for effective treatment in colon cancer. However, organ-specific toxicity will need to be investigated for further clinical prospects.</p></sec><sec id="sec5"><title>Declarations</title><sec id="sec5.1"><title>Author contribution statement</title><p id="p0255">Veerpal Kaur, Amit Goyal, Goutam Ghosh, Sudamsi Chandra, Goutam Rath: Conceived and designed the experiments; Performed the experiments; Analyzed and interpreted the data; Contributed reagents, materials, analysis tools or data; Wrote the paper.</p></sec><sec id="sec5.2"><title>Funding statement</title><p id="p0260">This research did not receive any specific grant from funding agencies in the public, commercial, or not-for-profit sectors.</p></sec><sec id="sec5.3"><title>Competing interest statement</title><p id="p0265">The authors declare no conflict of interest.</p></sec><sec id="sec5.4"><title>Additional information</title><p id="p0270">No additional information is available for this paper.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ref-list id="cebib0010"><title>References</title><ref id="bib1"><element-citation publication-type="journal" id="sref1"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Al-Hashemi</surname><given-names>H.M.B.</given-names></name><name><surname>Al-Amoudi</surname><given-names>O.S.B.</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>A&#x000a0;review on the angle of repose of granular materials</article-title><source>Powder Technol.</source><volume>330</volume><year>2018</year><fpage>397</fpage><lpage>417</lpage></element-citation></ref><ref id="bib2"><element-citation publication-type="journal" id="sref2"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Alibolandi</surname><given-names>M.</given-names></name><name><surname>Rezvani</surname><given-names>R.</given-names></name><name><surname>Farzad</surname><given-names>S.A.</given-names></name><name><surname>Taghdisi</surname><given-names>S.M.</given-names></name><name><surname>Abnous</surname><given-names>K.</given-names></name><name><surname>Ramezani</surname><given-names>M.</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Tetrac-conjugated polymersomes for integrin-targeted delivery of camptothecin to colon adenocarcinoma in vitro and in vivo</article-title><source>Int.
