The patient was presented in the local hospitalized where he lived because of lower back pain after lumbar sprain was confirmed to be with stones in the right kidney and severe hydronephrosis by colored ultrasound and IVP(Intravenous pyelography) a month ago. Then the patient came to our section. When he came, his BP(blood pressure) was 120/76&#x000a0;mmHg, body temperature was 36.5&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C and costovertebral angle percussion pain when the patient hospitalized. By abdominal ultrasound after hospitalized, the right collecting system of the patient was separated, and there were a number of anechoic areas which were indifferent sizes. The sections were linked to each other, one of the largest section was 6.4&#x000a0;cm&#x000a0;&#x000d7;&#x000a0;3.5&#x000a0;cm, which we saw a number of strong lights with acoustic shadow behind them. Another section size was 2.0&#x000a0;cm&#x000a0;&#x000d7;&#x000a0;1.5&#x000a0;cm in upper ureteral and its length of 4.2cm had strong light which the size was 1.6cm and with acoustic shadow behind it. The left renal collecting system had bright concentrations, ureter was not imaging. There were low echo which the anteroposterior diameter of 1.2cm in front of abdominal aorta and connected with the left and right lower pole of the kidney. Other organs like liver, cholecyst, spleen, pancreas, prostate were healthy. The filtration rate of 41.52 ml/min in right kidney and 35.76 ml/min in left were revealed by ECT. CT (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>) and KUB (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>) indicated: lower renal pole of both kidneys were mutual fusion across to abdominal aorta. The right renal pelvis showed image of multiple irregular mass and nodular higher density, the largest one was about 2.3&#x000a0;cm&#x000a0;&#x000d7;&#x000a0;2.0&#x000a0;cm. The right renal pelvis and calices were irregularly expanded, part of renal parenchyma thinned. The renal parenchyma of left was normal. The results showed: horseshoe kidney, right kidney with multiple stones, hydronephrosis. Other laboratory examination no abnormalities. The right retrograde pyelography was examined and indwelling catheter the size of F5 before operation for Understanding of ureteral stenosis. The percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PCNL) was operated in spinal anesthesia combined with epidural anesthesia after all of the examination.<fig id="fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>CT for pre-operative examination, right kidney with multiple stones, hydronephrosis.</p></caption><alt-text id="alttext0010">Fig. 1</alt-text><graphic xlink:href="gr1"/></fig><fig id="fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>Preoperative KUB, right kidney with multiple stones.</p></caption><alt-text id="alttext0015">Fig. 2</alt-text><graphic xlink:href="gr2"/></fig></p><p id="p0020">The patient lied prostrate after narcotized. Normally disinfecting operation field and operating drape. The costal margin between scapular line and the posterior axillary line on the right side for the puncture site, breakthrough was obvious when the percutaneous puncture of renal calyces under the guidance of ultrasound. The diluent Methylthionine Chloride was injected in the reserved ureteral catheter and there was pale blue liquid outflowed when needle core exited proved successfully puncture. The needle sheath is placed within the safety guide wire. After guide wire was inserted into the renal pelvic guided by ultrasound, establishing the standard channel expansion by F10, F12, F14, F16, F18, F20 fascia dilator successively. And then nephroscope was placed. There were multiple stones in the lower calyx of right kidney and obstructive cast stone in the ureteropelvic junction discovered by exploration. Then imbedding EMS system, if the stones were hard or some exposed not completely and holmium laser lithotripsy was not able to operate, use the EMS system. Operating renal pelvis, lower calyceal successively and to avoid damage the mucous membrane of renal pelvis during surgery. There are no significant residual stones in the renal pelvis and calyx only some stone powder confirmed by ultrasound. Nephroscope was placed in the ureteropelvic junction on the right side, then Zebra Urological Guidewire was placed into the bladder from ureter of right side and pull out the F5 ureteral catheter. Placing antegrade placement of F5 double-j catheter and right nephrostomy tube properly fixed, at the same time clipping half an hour. The operation was operated well and intraoperative bleeding was about 30ml. Little bloody fluid discharged from postoperative catheter, and when the color gets darker, proceeded bladder irrigation to prevent blood clot blocking catheter. Closely monitoring vital signs, gave the anti-infection and fluid replacement therapy. The curative effect was very satisfying by KUB after stay in bed for 3 days reviewed (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>). The double-j catheter was safely removed one month later and the patient urinated well by himself. Follow-up for 12 months, he was free of lower back pain and no stone recurrence found by ultrasound.<fig id="fig3"><label>Fig. 3</label><caption><p>KUB of 3 days after the operation, stones were totally cleared and double-J catheter was placed properly.</p></caption><alt-text id="alttext0020">Fig. 3</alt-text><graphic xlink:href="gr3"/></fig></p></sec><sec id="sec3"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="p0025">In this case, we chose costal margin between right scapular line and posterior axillary line as puncture site guided by ultrasound and into from upper renal calices. We used single standard channel (F20) percutaneous nephrolithotomy combined with holmium laser and EMS system to deal with multiple stones in middle and lower kidney and ureteropelvic junction stone. Percutaneous endoscopic combined with holmium laser and EMS system will sucking off by suction device directly after crushing stones, the clearance rate of stone is higher with less complications and light renal injury. Because of holmium laser with high efficiency of lithotripsy and the flexibility of the fiber, so if the stone is hard or not completely revealed, we first use holmium laser lithotripsy, then the EMS system to greatly increase stone clearance rate. In addition, there were no obvious residual stones in the renal pelvis and calyces probed by ultrasound during operation. One-time treatment effect and the recovery of patient was satisfying.</p></sec><sec id="sec4"><title>Funding</title><p id="p0030">This research did not receive any specific grant from funding agencies in the public, commercial, or not-for-profit sectors.</p></sec><sec sec-type="data-availability" id="sec5"><title>Availability of data and materials</title><p id="p0035">The authors presented the essential data within the manuscript.</p></sec><sec id="sec6"><title>Authors&#x02019; contributions</title><p id="p0040">MTL drafted the manuscript and was responsible for critical revisions.
