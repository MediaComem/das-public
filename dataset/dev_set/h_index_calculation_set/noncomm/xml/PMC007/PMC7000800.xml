As the only oral anticoagulant approved in Canada for patients with advanced chronic kidney disease, warfarin is the standard of care for patients with end-stage kidney disease for the treatment and prevention of venous thromboembolism, and the prevention of thromboembolic events in patients with mechanical heart valves or atrial fibrillation.<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></p><p id="p0015">In the nondialysis atrial fibrillation population, the literature suggests that consistent maintenance of the international normalized ratio (INR) in the appropriate therapeutic range, specifically a TTR of greater than 60%, is associated with an improvement in stroke prevention and mitigation of bleeding risk.<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr"><sup>6</sup></xref> However, only a handful of studies has investigated TTR in the HD population.<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> In each of these studies, TTR achievement was consistently poor.</p><p id="p0020">Despite the widespread problem of low TTR achievement in the HD population, only 2 studies have examined strategies to improve warfarin control in patients receiving HD, and both were unsuccessful.<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr"><sup>8</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr"><sup>12</sup></xref> To date, no study has described the implementation of sequential interventions as an initiative to improve the quality of warfarin control in patients receiving HD.</p><p id="p0025">An audit of our local data revealed a large-quality gap in managing patients taking warfarin in our HD unit, with an average of only 40% &#x000b1; 5% of patients achieving a quarterly TTR &#x0003e;60%.

Our HD unit provides maintenance dialysis to approximately 250 outpatients each month across 8 shifts: thrice-weekly conventional HD is administered on 6 shifts and the other 2 are devoted to long-duration in-center nocturnal HD. The care of each patient, including warfarin dose adjustment, was managed by a team comprising 1 of 4 nurse practitioners and 1 of 9 nephrologists. Local practice was to measure INR on a weekly basis, typically before the first dialysis session of the week, for all patients receiving warfarin. Additional measures of INR were occasionally requested when deemed to be clinically necessary by the primary prescriber (either a nurse practitioner or a nephrologist). Warfarin was adjusted according to clinician judgment without a specific protocol or algorithm. All INR measures drawn for each HD patient were captured within our local dialysis facility electronic health record and were extractable along with corresponding time-stamps and patient identifiers at quarterly intervals.</p></sec><sec id="sec1.2"><title>Generation of TTR</title><p id="p0035">We audited our in-center HD unit to assess whether a quality gap in TTR achievement existed at our institution. The population of interest included all patients who had received warfarin for at least 3 months during the 12-month period from October 1, 2016, through September 30, 2017. INRs for each patient during discrete 13-week intervals (quarters, Q1 [January&#x02013;March], Q2 [April&#x02013;June], Q3 [July&#x02013;September], Q4 [October&#x02013;December]) were used to generate up to 4 quarterly TTRs using the Rosendaal method.<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr"><sup>13</sup></xref> The Rosendaal method of calculating TTR is widely accepted as a surrogate for efficacy and safety<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr"><sup>13</sup></xref> and the quality standard is a TTR &#x0003e;60%.<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr"><sup>6</sup></xref> Our audit revealed that an average of 40% &#x000b1; 5% of patients achieved a quarterly TTR &#x0003e;60% during this 12-month baseline period.</p><p id="p0040">The TTR for each patient in each quarter was calculated using an Excel template that was programmed to calculate TTR by the Rosendaal method using linear interpolation (<xref rid="appsec1" ref-type="sec">Supplementary Table&#x000a0;S1</xref>).<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr"><sup>13</sup></xref> The template requires input of INR values with corresponding blood-draw dates. All data entry was performed by one of the authors (DB). Target INR lower and upper limits were set to 1.999 and 3.001, except for the rare cases of patients with a mechanical valve in which the target limits were reset to 2.499 and 3.501. We excluded quarters in which warfarin was initiated, quarters in which warfarin initiation was within the last 4 weeks of the preceding quarter, quarters in which patients were admitted to hospital, and quarters in which warfarin was intentionally interrupted for any reason. In quarters in which patients were either admitted to hospital or warfarin was intentionally interrupted, a value of &#x0201c;n/a&#x0201d; was included in the TTR report. For all other quarters, TTR was calculated and reported as a percentage in the TTR report.</p></sec><sec id="sec1.3"><title>Intervention</title><p id="p0045">We interviewed local nephrologists, nurse practitioners, pharmacists, and nurses to create a process map for the system of warfarin prescription for our HD patients. From the information gathered, we hypothesized that the root causes of poor TTR achievement in our HD unit were (i) lack of TTR awareness on the part of patients and providers leading to overestimation of the safety of the current management strategy, and (ii) labile INR as a result of nonstandardized dosing changes. In addition, we discovered that there was no standardized reassessment of ongoing warfarin prescription; therefore, once warfarin was initiated for any indication, it was often continued until a clinical event (for example, a bleed) prompted its reassessment. Consequently, we proposed that a reassessment of ongoing warfarin prescription should be regularly performed to avoid inappropriate exposure to warfarin (see <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table&#x000a0;1</xref>).<table-wrap position="float" id="tbl1"><label>Table&#x000a0;1</label><caption><p>Common proximal causes of poor time in therapeutic range (TTR) achievement in our unit based on stakeholder interviews, and recommendations for improvement</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reason for poor TTR achievement</th><th>Recommendation for improvement</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Lack of TTR awareness on the part of patients and providers</td><td>Audit and feedback reporting of time in therapeutic range, with patient engagement</td></tr><tr><td>Labile international normalized ratio as a result of nonstandardized warfarin dosing changes</td><td>Standardized warfarin dosing algorithms, and verbal and/or written reminders following warfarin dose changes</td></tr><tr><td>Lack of standardized reassessment of ongoing warfarin prescription</td><td>Standardized quarterly reassessment of risk and benefit of ongoing anticoagulation with warfarin</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap></p><p id="p0050">In October 2017 we audited our local practice and generated data on local TTR achievement at the HD unit level. The initial audit results were then disclosed to warfarin prescribers as a group. We subsequently planned a series of targeted interventions. As our first planned intervention, we reported each patient's individualized trend in quarterly TTR to their warfarin prescriber in an audit and feedback report that also prompted the prescriber to reassess the need for ongoing warfarin anticoagulation. The template&#x02019;s first iteration prompted the prescriber to choose from 1 of 3 options: (i) stop warfarin, (ii) continue warfarin and reassess next quarter, or (iii) continue warfarin and reassess in 1 year. Based on user feedback and review with engaged stakeholders, the template underwent 4 revisions over time.

Respondents also provided positive feedback on our interventions, writing that their management was &#x0201c;more satisfying due to the report card of time in therapeutic range&#x0201d; and expressing that &#x0201c;uniform adoption of the algorithm available at the main desk would be very beneficial to all patients on warfarin.&#x0201d;</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec3"><title>Discussion</title><p id="p0120">An audit of TTR for warfarin achievement in our HD unit identified a significant quality gap. We subsequently developed a quality improvement program using an iterative audit-feedback report with the aim of improving TTR achievement at our hospital. The program was successful over a period of 12 months during which time the baseline mean &#x000b1; SD of 40% &#x000b1; 5% improved significantly to a post-intervention mean &#x000b1; SD of 61% &#x000b1; 8%.</p><p id="p0125">The literature suggests a widespread problem of low TTR achievement among warfarin recipients in the HD population.<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> This is the first report to show improvement using a strategy of audit-feedback. In a prior report that examined strategies to improve warfarin control in HD patients, Lamontagne <italic>et&#x000a0;al.</italic><xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr"><sup>8</sup></xref> showed that uniform adoption of a warfarin dosing algorithm did not improve TTR but did reduce resource utilization. In another publication, Thomson <italic>et&#x000a0;al.</italic><xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr"><sup>12</sup></xref> showed that on-target anticoagulation was unchanged, but resource utilization was reduced, when local practice was shifted from physician-directed warfarin dosing to an electronic warfarin anticoagulation normogram implemented by HD nurses. In contrast to these studies, our change strategy may have been successful because we used iterative plan-do-study-act cycles to target interventions to a series of root causes of poor TTR achievement in our local setting, rather than deploying a single intervention on warfarin dosing.</p><p id="p0130">Strengths of our initiative included the use of a formal quality improvement approach with front-line engagement, consistent uptake of our interventions, the incorporation of qualitative feedback into the intervention, and confirmation of our findings in prespecified additional analyses. We engaged all the key stakeholders in the warfarin prescription process by educating them about the deficiencies in the process and subsequently secured their complete commitment to the achievement of sustained improvement.</p><p id="p0135">Limitations of our initiative included the restriction to a single center and the relatively small number of warfarin recipients. Another limitation was that we could not verify adherence with some of the proposed strategies to improve TTR; specifically, we could not verify adherence to the C.A.R.E. warfarin dosing algorithm nor could we verify consistent provision of verbal and/or written reminders for patients. Finally, a larger study is needed to determine whether implementation of this initiative translates into a reduction in thromboembolic phenomena and/or a lower rate of bleeding.</p><p id="p0140">In conclusion, we describe the implementation of a quality improvement initiative that led to a sustained improvement in the TTR for warfarin. Given the well-established relationship between TTR for warfarin and clinical outcomes, improving TTR achievement may translate into reduced bleeding risk and better protection against thrombosis. We encourage broader testing of our initiative to evaluate whether its adoption will affect clinical events.</p></sec><sec id="sec4"><title>Disclosure</title><p id="p0145">All the authors declared no
