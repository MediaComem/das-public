As early as 1845, Hecker presented the disease with the name &#x0201c;varix spurius circumscriptus venae diploicae frontalis,&#x0201d; which became known as sinus pericranii only in 1850 when Stromeyer defined the disease as &#x0201c;a subperiosteal cystic sac filled with blood that communicates with an intracranial sinus.&#x0201d;[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</p><p>SP is considered a rare benign venous abnormality, comprising an intradiploic emissary vein derived from an intracranial sinus,[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] causing increased subgaleal drain consisting of a network of thin-walled veins forming varicose veins in the skull outer table.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]</p><p>Due to the rarity of the disease, its pathogenesis and natural history remain obscure.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] It is believed that the main etiology is congenital, which is justified by anomalous and late venous development during embryogenesis and an incomplete closure of the cranial suture, which is associated with an abundant number of diploic and emissary veins.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] Rare traumatic associations have been reported due to the rupture of emissary veins associated with small cranial fractures or even by direct lacerations of the dural venous sinuses, allowing the development of aberrant communications between the epicranial and dural venous systems.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] However, it is believed that, even in these cases, there is a genetic predisposition. This is corroborated by the frequent association with intracranial developmental venous anomalies.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</p><p>Regarding gender distribution, some authors believe that there is a slight predominance in females,[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] but others believe that, if we consider the SPs of traumatic origin, this distribution would be even and may even have a predominance in males.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] The reported age ranges from 0 to 70 years being more common in children and young adults.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</p><p>The diagnosis can be made with Doppler ultrasonography/computed tomography (CT)/magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)/magnetic resonance angiography (MRA)/angiotomography (CTA), and digital subtraction angiography (DSA), with DSA being the gold standard.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]</p><p>An SP is considered true when changes in shape, size, or vascularity are observed with maneuvers that cause elevated intracranial pressure (ICP), such as Trendelenburg position, sudden neck flexion, jugular vein compression, Valsalva, cough, and crying.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] As the vessels are strongly adhered to the periosteum and there is a direct connection with the intracranial venous system, changes in ICP cause changes in the size of vessels, especially on the outside.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</p><p>There is no scientific consensus about the choice of the best modality for treatment, which can include from open surgeries, such as the repair of the cranioestenosis and the manual ligation, until endovascular procedures, such as the percutaneous and transvenous embolization, or even percutaneous puncture direct and combined approaches.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]</p><p>We report the case of a child with a large SP who was successfully treated only with embolization by percutaneous phlebography.</p></sec><sec id="sec1-2"><title>CASE REPORT</title><p>A 10-month-old female child presented with a pulsatile mass on the posterior parietal region with fremitus in the midline. There was no head trauma history and no neurological deficit on physical examination. Brain CT, MRI, MRA [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>] and CTA [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>] demonstrated a venous malformation communicating with the superior sagittal sinus under the scalp, without arterial feeder or nidus. We performed an endovascular embolization with coils to decrease the lesion's flow. Following this, an intracranial standard venous phase catheter cerebral DSA was performed, while the lesion was temporarily obliterated by external compression, followed by a percutaneous embolization in one single-session with Onyx &#x000ae; (ev3, USA) [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>], a nonadhesive liquid embolic agent. The final phlebography [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>] showed complete exclusion of the lesion. The infant achieved good recovery, and a late control DSA confirmed exclusion of the SP. After 6 months, there was no evidence of mass due to absorption. The girl remains asymptomatic and without visible aesthetic defects after 8 years of follow-up.</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>3D reconstruction of brain MRA (venous phase).

At present, there are just over 100 reported cases of SP in the literature.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]</p><p>The lesion in our patient is a typical example of this disease &#x02013; it was unique, was located in the midline in the parietal region, and measured 3 cm. The main location of the SP is midline or parasagittal (95%), distributed mainly in the frontal (43%) and parietal regions (36%). Other less common locations include occipital (8%), frontoparietal (5%), parietooccipital (3%), occipitotemporal (3%), and temporal (2%). The size of the conglomerate of extracranial vessels may range from 1 to 13 cm, more commonly between 2 and 6 cm. The skull defect varies between 1 and 4 mm, and large defects are rare.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</p><p>Like most cases, our patient was asymptomatic, with only complaints regarding the aesthetic defect. However, there are reports of diverse clinical presentation, from mild symptoms such as local pain, nausea, headache, feeling of pressure, and dizziness to more complex and serious symptoms such as abrupt increase in ICP, bradycardia, ataxia, and even bradycardia.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] It is also worth mentioning that, although majority of patients have a benign evolution, some have complications such as massive hemorrhage (spontaneous or traumatic), infection, thrombosis, gas embolism, abrupt increase of ICP, and even severe heart failure.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] There are also reports of association of anomalies, such as meningocele, hemangioma, macrocrania, cavernoma, craniosynostosis,[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] aneurysm, and arteriovenous malformations. Cavernous hemangiomas, in addition to angiomas, meningoencephaloceles, meningoceles, and cephalohematomas, are also the main diagnostic differences. Symptomatic SP or with a significant cosmetic deformity are strong candidates for surgical treatment.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]</p><p>Surgical excision, in a majority of cases, besides endovascular embolization, has positive results (cure, stabilization or emergencies/complications resolution).[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</p><p>SPs are classified according to their vascular architecture, which helps in determining treatment approach. When interfering with SP circulation, the circulation of the associated dural venous sinus is also compromised, they are called dominant SP (25% of the cases). However, when the associated sinus vascularization does not change, regardless of the maneuver, SP is said accessory (75%).[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] In the present case, through DSA and compression maneuvers of the scalp, it was possible to evaluate the repercussion of an intervention in the global venous drainage. The treatment was well indicated because, since it was an accessory SP, there was minimal chance of causing sequelae.</p><p>DSA plays a crucial role in the classification of SP and choice of optimal treatment. Although surgery is curative, some studies have reported significant hemorrhage because of dural sinus lacerations.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] The endovascular approach is becoming increasingly relevant and has proven to be safe and effective.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] Especially in the case of a young child, with a higher surgical risk due to blood loss, we opted for percutaneous treatment guided by endovascular view.</p><p>Endovascular treatment of SP with N-butyl cyanoacrylate glue is possible, but we opted for the liquid embolic agent Onyx &#x000ae; (ethylene-vinyl alcohol copolymer). This has been used in the endovascular treatment of intracranial arteriovenous malformations, arteriovenous fistulas, and other venous malformations with excellent results.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] The use of this agent in high-blood flow vessels is reliable and safe. Its use in low-flow vessels, such as veins, can be considered even safer.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]</p><p>There is risk to skin ulceration beyond pulmonary or systemic embolization. The latter could be minimized with use of &#x0201c;armored concrete&#x0201d; embolization (use of coils and Onyx).[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-4"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>This is the first described case of SP treated in a single session by percutaneous embolization with coils (via endovascular) and Onyx (percutaneous). Although asymptomatic and only with an aesthetic objective, the treatment was well indicated when assessing the repercussion in the global venous drainage through angiography with maneuvers of compression of the scalp.</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Declaration of patient consent</title><p>The authors certify that they have obtained all appropriate patient consent forms.
