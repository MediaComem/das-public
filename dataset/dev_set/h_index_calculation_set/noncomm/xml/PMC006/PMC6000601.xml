Recently, some laboratory markers of activated coagulation such as D-dimer and fibrin degradation products were reported to be elevated during acute phase of the disease, reflecting the disease activity of HSP.<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></p><p>HSP per se is a self-limiting disease. Although the prognosis of HSP usually shows a favorable clinical outcome, serious complications requiring hospitalization and surgical treatment such as massive GI bleeding, bowel ischemia and infarction, perforation, and intussusception can occur when the GI tract is involved.<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> Therefore, treatment with steroids has been indicated in HSP patients presenting with serious GI symptoms such as severe abdominal pain and hematochezia. If severe GI symptoms persist despite steroid therapy, additional treatment with intravenous immunoglobulins (IVIG), high dose methylprednisolone pulse therapy, immunosuppressants, or plasma exchange therapy are required consequently.<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> As previously reported, 2 of 10 children treated with only steroid for serious GI involvement underwent surgery for bowel perforation and intussusception, while the other 12 treated with additional IVIG did not.<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> Renal involvement of HSP with persistent proteinuria and/or hematuria also requires therapeutic strategies, since long-term prognosis of HSP depends on the severity of renal involvement.<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></p><p>Up to date, only limited information has been available regarding the epidemiological characteristics of childhood HSP; this may be one of the reasons for why there are no clinical guidelines or consensuses on the diagnosis and treatment of HSP yet, despite its clinical significance.</p><p>In the current issue of <italic>Journal of Korean Medical Science</italic>, Shim et al.<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> have reported the nationwide population-based epidemiological data on the clinical characteristics of HSP in Korean children for the first time. According to this study, the annual incidence of HSP was 55.9 per 100,000 children which was much higher in Korea than 6.1&#x02013;30.0 per 100,000 children of those previously reported in other countries including Taiwan.<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> The peak age of HSP was 5 years, mainly involving young children, and HSP showed seasonal variation with the higher incidence in spring and winter, commonly accompanied by preceding upper respiratory infections, as reported previously.<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> Younger children showed more severe disease courses, and steroid therapy was more frequently used in complicated cases.<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> Because previous reports are mostly based on single center studies or multicenter surveys at most, this nationwide study by Shim et al.<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> provides valuable data on childhood HSP.</p><p>However, since childhood HSP differs from adult HSP both in clinical manifestations and outcomes, further nationwide surveys involving both children and adults are required in the future. Furthermore, development of practice guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of childhood HSP based on nationwide data may be necessary for better practice because children with HSP should be approached differently from adult patients.</p></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="COI-statement"><p><bold>Disclosure:</bold> The author has no potential conflicts of interest to disclose.</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><ref id="B1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Kang</surname><given-names>Y</given-names></name><name><surname>Park</surname><given-names>JS</given-names></name><name><surname>Ha</surname><given-names>YJ</given-names></name><name><surname>Kang</surname><given-names>MI</given-names></name><name><surname>Park</surname><given-names>HJ</given-names></name><name><surname>Lee</surname><given-names>SW</given-names></name><etal/></person-group><article-title>Differences in clinical manifestations and outcomes between adult and child patients with Henoch-Sch&#x000f6;nlein purpura</article-title><source>J Korean Med Sci</source><year>2014</year><volume>29</volume><issue>2</issue><fpage>198</fpage><lpage>203</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">24550645</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="B2"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Lee</surname><given-names>YH</given-names></name><name><surname>Kim</surname><given-names>YB</given-names></name><name><surname>Koo</surname><given-names>JW</given-names></name><name><surname>Chung</surname><given-names>JY</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Henoch-Sch&#x000f6;nlein purpura in children hospitalized at a tertiary hospital during 2004&#x02013;2015 in Korea: epidemiology and clinical management</article-title><source>Pediatr Gastroenterol Hepatol Nutr</source><year>2016</year><volume>19</volume><issue>3</issue><fpage>175</fpage><lpage>185</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">27738599</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="B3"><label>3</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Hong</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name><name><surname>Yang</surname><given-names>HR</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Laboratory markers indicating gastrointestinal involvement of henoch-sch&#x000f6;nlein purpura in children</article-title><source>Pediatr Gastroenterol Hepatol Nutr</source><year>2015</year><volume>18</volume><issue>1</issue><fpage>39</fpage><lpage>47</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">25866732</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="B4"><label>4</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Yang</surname><given-names>HR</given-names></name><name><surname>Choi</surname><given-names>WJ</given-names></name><name><surname>Ko</surname><given-names>JS</given-names></name><name><surname>Seo</surname><given-names>JK</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Intravenous immunoglobulin for severe gastrointestinal manifestation of Henoch-Sch&#x004e7;nlein purpura refractory to corticosteroid therapy</article-title><source>Korean J Pediatr</source><year>2006</year><volume>49</volume><issue>7</issue><fpage>784</fpage><lpage>789</lpage></element-citation></ref><ref id="B5"><label>5</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Shim</surname><given-names>JO</given-names></name><name><surname>Han</surname><given-names>KD</given-names></name><name><surname>Park</surname><given-names>SH</given-names></name><name><surname>Kim</surname><given-names>GH</given-names></name><name><surname>Ko</surname><given-names>JS</given-names></name><name><surname>Chung</surname><given-names>JY</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Ten-year nationwide population-based survey on the characteristics of children with Henoch-Sch&#x004e7;nlein purpura in Korea</article-title><source>J Korean Med Sci</source><year>2018</year><volume>33</volume><issue>25</issue><elocation-id>e174</elocation-id></element-citation></ref></ref-list></back></article>
