N4-methylation of the inner cytosines (C<sup>m4</sup>CAGG/C<sup>m4</sup>CTGG) protects the site against MvaI cleavage. Here, we show that MvaI nicks the G-strand of the related sequence (CCGGG/CCCGG, BcnI site) if the inner cytosines are C5-methylated: C<sup>m5</sup>C&#x02193;GGG/CC<sup>m5</sup>CGG. At M.SssI-methylated SmaI sites, where two oppositely oriented methylated BcnI sites partially overlap, double-nicking leads to double-strand cleavage (CC<sup>m5</sup>C&#x02193;GGG/CC<sup>m5</sup>C&#x02191;GGG) generating fragments with blunt ends. The double-strand cleavage rate and the stringency of substrate site recognition is lower at the methylation-dependent site than at the canonical target site. MvaI is the first restriction endonuclease shown to possess, besides the &#x02018;normal&#x02019; activity on its unmethylated recognition site, also a methylation-directed activity on a different sequence.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Type II restriction endonucleases (REases) are sequence-specific endonucleases that recognize short DNA sequences and cut the DNA at defined positions within or close to the recognition sequence. In the producer cell, the host DNA is protected by specific methylation of the recognition sequence. The specific methylation is established by DNA methyltransferases, which methylate a cytosine or an adenine in the recognition sequence to produce C5-methylcytosine, N4-methylcytosine or N6-methyladenine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>). The ability to cleave DNA at specific sites made Type II REases indispensable tools of molecular biology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>) as well as excellent model systems for the study of sequence-specific protein&#x02013;DNA interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>). Since their discovery 40 years ago (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>), the number of biochemically or genetically characterized Type II REases has risen to more than 3800 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>). This huge group of enzymes shows great diversity. Members are classified into subgroups according, among others, to the symmetry of the recognition sequence, the position of the cut site relative to the recognition sequence, the number of target sites the enzyme interacts with, etc. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>).</p><p>From the perspective of the present study, two subgroups of Type II REases are especially interesting. Enzymes in the Type IIM subgroup (methyl-directed REases) break the general rule of protection by DNA methylation; unlike most REases, they require methylated substrate site for activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>). The other subtype that deserves special attention, are nicking REases, which cut only one strand of the substrate DNA. Such enzymes include natural nicking REases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>), isolated subunits of heterodimeric REases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>) and mutant REases engineered to cut only one strand of the substrate DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>).</p><p>The MvaI REase recognizes the sequence 5&#x02032;-CC&#x02193;WGG-3&#x02032;/5&#x02032;-CC&#x02191;WGG-3&#x02032; (W stands for A or T) and cuts both strands as indicated generating one nucleotide 5&#x02032;-overhangs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>). The cognate DNA-methyltransferase M.MvaI modifies the internal cytosines to produce N4-methylcytosine: (C<sup>m4</sup>CWGG/C<sup>m4</sup>CWGG) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>). C5-methylation of the same cytosines does not protect against MvaI cleavage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>). MvaI was shown to recognize its pseudosymmetric target site as a monomer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>). An interesting feature of the enzyme is its tolerance to a wide range of modifications within the recognition sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>). MvaI shares &#x0223c;20% sequence identity and structural similarity with BcnI, an REase recognizing the related pseudopalindromic sequence CC/SGG (S stands for G or C) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13 B14 B15">13&#x02013;15</xref>).</p><p>Here, we show that MvaI, in addition to its double-stranded cleavage activity on the canonical recognition sequence CCWGG, nicks BcnI sites (C<underline>C</underline>&#x02193;GGG/CC<underline>C</underline>GG) as indicated, if the underlined cytosines are C5-methylated (5-methylcytosine, <sup>m5</sup>C). This nicking activity results in double-strand scisions at CC<sup>m5</sup>CGGG/CC<sup>m5</sup>CGGG sites, where two methylated BcnI sites overlap. To our knowledge, MvaI is the first REase that has been shown to have such dual specificity: cleaving two different sequences, one of them in a methylation-dependent manner.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Strains and growth conditions</title><p>The <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> strains DH10B F<sup>&#x02212;</sup>

Reversibility of the change in the digestion pattern ruled out the possibility that the new cleavage sites were created by mutations.

This plasmid carries the gene of the PspGI methyltransferase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>), and the MvaI sites of the plasmid are protected against MvaI digestion by PspGI-specific methylation (Shuang-yong Xu, personal communication).

Although the two sequences showed some similarity, the ability of the enzyme to act on both substrates was puzzling. The SmaI site is 1&#x02009;bp longer than the CCWGG site, and it is a perfect palindrom, whereas the canonical site has a quasi-palindromic sequence. The different ways of cleaving the two targets, i.e. staggered cut for the canonical site and blunt cut for the SmaI site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>), were even harder to accept because the cleavage mode is a tightly determined feature of Type II REases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>). Inspection of the SmaI site suggested an alternative interpretation. The SmaI site contains two partially overlapping and oppositely oriented BcnI sites (CCSGG), which differ from MvaI sites only in the central base pair. We hypothesized that the real second target site of MvaI is the methylated BcnI site, which is nicked by the enzyme, and the double-strand cleavage observed at the SmaI site was the result of double-nicking at the overlapping BcnI sites. One of the reasons why this idea seemed attractive was the monomeric nature of MvaI, which made nicking activity seem plausible. In principle, double-nicking at the SmaI site can produce blunt ends by two mechanisms: nicking the BcnI site in the G-strand (i.e. in the strand with G in the central position) or in the complementary C-strand (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>&#x02009;A). To distinguish between these alternatives, pUP41 plasmid DNA was methylated with M.SssI <italic>in vitro</italic>, digested to completion with MvaI, and used as template to sequence through one of the BcnI sites from both directions. When the G-strand was used as template, intensity of the sequencing signal dropped suddenly at the BcnI site, whereas it stayed constant with the C-strand template (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>B), indicating that MvaI nicks the G-strand.

To address this question, double-stranded oligonucleotides containing unmethylated (AK252/254), hemimethylated (AK253/254, AK252/255) or fully methylated (AK253/255) BcnI sites were prepared and <sup>32</sup>P-labeled as described in &#x02018;Materials and Methods&#x02019; section. The hemimethylated duplexes differed in that in AK253/254 the G-strand (C<sup>m5</sup>CGGG/CCCGG), whereas in AK252/255 the C-strand (CCGGG/CC<sup>m5</sup>CGG) was methylated (see also <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>). In all four duplexes the G-strand (AK252 or AK253) was radioactively labeled at the 3&#x02032;-end. Digestion mixtures contained &#x0223c;0.5&#x02009;&#x000b5;g pUC18 plasmid DNA, and completeness of digestion was checked by agarose gel electrophoresis of an aliquot of the reaction. Digestion products of the 30-bp oligonucleotides were analyzed by electrophoresis in denaturing polyacrylamide gels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>). Nicking of the G-strand or double-strand cut at the BcnI site was indicated by the appearance of a 19-nt fragment. The unmethylated duplex was highly but not completely resistant to MvaI digestion. We considered that the small amount of cleaved product obtained with the unmethylated susbstrate was the result of cutting oligonucleotides that had remained single-stranded after the annealing reaction. However, in control reactions, the 5&#x02032;-labeled, single-stranded AK252 oligonucleotide was not cleaved by MvaI (data not shown). Thus, the weak digestion detected with the AK252/254 duplex indicated that even the unmethylated BcnI site was nicked at low frequency by MvaI (see more on this below). Majority of the hemimethylated and fully methylated duplexes was cut by MvaI, showing that CG-specific methylation of either strand sensitizes the BcnI site for nicking. The fully methylated AK253/255 appeared to be a better substrate than the hemimethylated duplexes.

The &#x0223c;50% digestion of the target site methylated on both strands (C<underline>C</underline>GGG/CC<underline>C</underline>GG) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>) is in agreement with previous observations (cited in the REBASE database (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>)).</p><p>Digestion of double-stranded oligonucleotides showed that even unmethylated BcnI sites were nicked by MvaI at low rate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>). However, due to the high sensitivity of phosphor imaging simple visual evaluation of band intensity can overestimate the relative amount of material in faint bands. To obtain more reliable quantitative data, the phosphor image was analyzed by the ImageQuant software. For these experiments, to exclude the possibility of any artifact that might arise from the chemical synthesis or annealing of the oligonucleotides, a gel-purified DNA fragment was used. The <sup>32</sup>P-labeled 441 bp AvaII-SspI fragment of pUC18 containing a single BcnI site but no canonical MvaI site was extensively digested with MvaI and the cleavage products were analyzed by denaturing gel electrophoresis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>). With this substrate nicking of the BcnI site in the G-strand gives rise to a 175-nt long <sup>32</sup>P-labeled single-stranded fragment. pUC18 plasmid DNA added to some of the reactions served as internal control to monitor digestion. Completeness of digestion was tested by agarose gel electrophoresis of parts of the digestion mixtures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>&#x02009;C). Some nicking did occur in the MvaI-digested samples but, as densitometric analysis indicated, its amount was negligible (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>B). This is in agreement with the lack of observable double-strand cleavage at unmethylated SmaI sites in pUP41 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkq676/DC1">Supplementary Figure S1</ext-link>).

We have shown that, in addition to cutting its well-known recognition site (CC&#x02193;AGG/CC&#x02191;TGG), MvaI can nick BcnI sites if the underlined cytosines are C5-methylated (C<underline>C</underline>&#x02193;GGG/CC<underline>C</underline>GG). The single-strand scission occurs in the G-strand as indicated. Because at SmaI sites the nicking activity manifests in double-stranded cuts, it was straightforward to compare the cleavage rates between the two recognition sites. The methyl-directed double-stranded cleavage of the SmaI site is substantially slower than cleavage of the canonical MvaI sites, but it is still a relatively robust activity, not an obscure side-reaction. The methylation-dependent activity was detected in two different commercial MvaI preparations. One of these enzymes (Fermentas) was prepared from an overexpressing <italic>E. coli</italic> strain, whereas the Sigma enzyme was purified from the native host <italic>Micrococcus varians</italic> Rfl 19. Thus, it can be concluded that the new activity was not due to a contaminating enzyme in the commercial preparations, it is an inherent property of MvaI.</p><p>MvaI formally combines features of <bold>&#x02018;</bold>typical&#x02019; Type II REases cutting unmethylated sequences with those of methyl-directed Type II REases, which require methylated substrate sites. To our knowledge, MvaI is the first REase, for which such dual specificity has been shown. The new, methylation-dependent activity represents nicking and double-stranded cleavage specificities (C<sup>m5</sup>C&#x02193;GGG/CC<sup>m5</sup>CGG and CC<sup>m5</sup>C&#x02193;GGG/CC<sup>m5</sup>C&#x02191;GGG) that were not known before. It must be noted, however, that the methyl-directed activity is less specific than the canonical activity, recognition of the substrate sequence is less tightly determined than for the CCWGG site.</p><p>When we try to interpret the new MvaI activity in the light of previous results, the following data can be considered. There are four Type IIP REases (MspI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>), HinPI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>), MvaI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>) and BcnI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>)), which were shown by X-ray crystallography to act as monomers. All four enzymes contact their palindromic or pseudopalindromic substrate sites asymmetrically, contacting both strands of the recognition sequence. The asymmetry of the recognition complexes suggest that these enzymes act as nicking enzymes and cut the double-stranded substrate in two sequential nicking reactions. The cleavage mechanism has so far been tested for MvaI and HinPI. MvaI was shown to preferentially cleave the A-strand of the target site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>) and HinPI displayed nicking activity on supercoiled DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>). Further support for the nicking mechanism comes from observations with MvaI, BcnI and the monomeric DNA mismatch repair protein MutH. There is structural similarity between the three proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>), and MutH was shown to be a nicking enzyme, making single-strand scissions on the unmethylated strand of hemimethylated Gm6ATC sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>). Against this background, the nicking activity of MvaI detected in this study is not surprising. Nicking the strand with the purine base in the center (the G-strand) may relate to the preferential cleavage of the A-strand observed for the canonical site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>).</p><p>The canonical recognition site of MvaI is characterized by A/T ambiguity: the enzyme accepts A : T or T : A (W), but exludes G : C and C : G (S) base pairs in the center of the target sequence. PspGI, another REase recognizing CCWGG flips the central adenine and thymine out of the helix and uses this mechanism to discriminate between W and S (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>). In the MvaI recognition complex, no flipping of the central base pairs was observed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>). In an intact helix, because of the geometry of the base pairs and the position of the groups that can act as hydrogen bond donors or acceptors, differentiation between the W and S base pairs has to rely mainly on interactions in the minor groove (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>). There are observations to suggest that this mechanism is less perfect than recognition of single base pairs mediated predominantly by interactions in the major groove. For example, the SinI DNA methyltransferase, whose normal target sequence is GGWCC, methylates, albeit at much lower rate, also GGSCC sites. Moreover, relaxed specificity M.SinI mutants with impaired capacity to discriminate between the two sites were relatively easy to isolate, suggesting that the W versus S discrimination is less tightly determined than recognition of well-defined unique base pairs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>). From the crystal structure of the MvaI&#x02013;DNA complex, it is not entirely clear how recognition of the W base pairs is accomplished, especially as in the crystal only one of the two possible binding modes was represented (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>). The results presented here demonstrate that adding a C5-methyl group to the indicated cytosines (C<underline>C</underline>GGG/CC<underline>C</underline>GG) in either strand seriously impairs the ability of MvaI to discriminate between W and S in the center of the target sequence. The effects seem to be additive, as can be concluded from the more complete cleavage of the duplex modified on both strands (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>). One of the modified cytosines is in the center of the BcnI site, at the position occupied by the A : T base pair in the canonical recogniton sequence. It is tempting to speculate that the 5-methylcytosine mimics the thymine in the major groove, and this is a major factor in the recognition of the methylated BcnI site. However, in such a model, binding to the C-strand would involve cleavage of the C-strand as can be inferred from the crystal structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>), which would be inconsistent with the experimental observation of G-strand nicking (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>). It needs structural studies to determine how C5-methylation of the cytosines leads to the observed change of sequence specificity.</p></sec><sec><title>SUPPLEMENTARY DATA</title><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkq676/DC1">Supplementary Data</ext-link> are available at NAR Online.</p></sec><sec><title>FUNDING</title><p>This work was supported by the Hungarian Scientific Research Fund grant NI61786.
