The amounts of native as well as transfected prion protein (PrP) are transiently lowered in various cell lines following phosphorothioate oligodeoxynucleotides (PS-DNA) exposure. The N-terminus domain of PrP is essential for this degradation that is independent of the PS-DNA sequence. Proteins not responsive to PS-DNA could be degraded upon PS-DNA exposure, following introduction of the N-terminus of the PrP into their sequence. These observations may serve as the basis for a general method for transient targeted modulation of the levels of desired recombinant surface proteins in cell cultures, and for the development of Prion disease future therapeutic strategies.</p><p><bold>Heera Krishna (University of Colorado-Boulder, USA)</bold></p></sec><sec><title>Oligo(deoxyribonucleoside) methylphosphine borane: a novel hybrid molecule for the oligonucleotide chemist&#x02019;s toolbox</title><p>Heera Krishna and Marvin H. Caruthers</p><p>The major hurdle associated with utilizing oligo deoxyribonucleotides for therapeutic purposes has been their poor delivery into cells coupled with high nuclease susceptibility. Heera proposed that the relatively unexplored methylphosphine borane linkage (Me-P-BH3), derived from precursors of known antisense activity, might prove to be more effective than its well-known individual counterparts. She developed efficient solid-phase synthesis strategies for synthesizing chimeric oligonucleotides bearing novel methylphosphine&#x02013;borane linkages. Preliminary biological studies on the uptake and cellular distribution of these compounds have been evaluated. Preliminary results imply that the potential utility of these molecules as efficient tools in antisense research and RNAi needs to be explored.</p><p><bold>Johanna E.

PNA-directed clamping PCR method allows them to discriminate and quantify the amount of mixed alleles which differ by only one base pair. They also designed RNA-cleaving DNAzymes that specifically target and cleave both the BCR&#x02013;ABL junction and the site of point mutation (T315I) in BCR&#x02013;ABL mRNA. The designed DNAzymes are effective in cleaving the target RNA specifically, distinguishing the T315I point mutation from the wild type RNA. When the DNAzymes are transfected into pro-B lymphoid cell line with Gleevec resistance (BCR&#x02013;ABL/BaF3T315I), both expression of BCR-ABL protein and proliferation of Gleevec-resistant leukemic cells are inhibited.</p><p><bold>Partha Ray (Duke University Medical Center, Durham, NC, USA)</bold></p></sec><sec><title>Aptamers as tools for the identification and detection of pancreatic cancer biomarkers</title><p>Partha Ray, Bruce A.
