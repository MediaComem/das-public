The theta band EROs occurring in the P3 response, important indicators of neurocognitive function, were elicited during the evaluation of task-relevant target stimuli in visual and auditory oddball tasks from 9 electrode locations. These tasks call upon attentional and working memory resources. The developmental trajectories of the EROs have large sex differences; scalp location and task modality (visual or auditory) differences within males and females were small compared to sex differences. Associations between the theta EROs and genotypic variants of 21 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from cholinergic genes <italic toggle="yes">CHRM2</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">CHRNA3</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">CHRNA5</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">CHRNA6</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">CHRNB1</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">CHRNB3</italic>, and <italic toggle="yes">CHRNB4</italic>, measured by effect sizes of genotypic covariates in the regression analysis, were found to vary with age, sex, task modality, and scalp locality. Seven of the SNPs had significant effects with considerable age spans for some sex-modality combination. Eight of the SNPs had significantly different effects in males and females with considerable age spans for either one or both modalities. No SNP at any age-modality combination had significant effects in the same direction for males and females. Principal component analysis (PCA) of the genotypic profiles (vector of values of genotypic associations) of phenotypes identified the age variation in genotypic profiles which discriminate sex, modality, and locality differences in phenotypes. The physiological processes responsible for large sex differences in genotypic effect on brain function have yet to be determined.</p></sec><sec id="S2"><label>2</label><title>Theta EROs: Phenotypic and Association Trajectories</title><sec id="S3"><label>2.1</label><title>Background and Methods</title><p id="P3">In a previous study (<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">Chorlian et al., 2015</xref>), developmental trajectories of theta EROs extending from ages 12 to 25 were determined by non-parametric regression (loess) using as covariates sex, family type (control or alcoholic), and the first two principal components from the stratification analysis of the genetic dataset. Following the determination of the trajectories of the ERO values the trajectories of the genotypic associations of the ERO values were determined. The developmental trajectories (time-series) of the association between cholinergic gene variants and theta band EROs are defined by the effect size of the genetic variants in the non-parametric regression model of the theta band EROs, to which genotype (using an additive model) and a genotype &#x000d7; sex interaction, were added as covariates. For this study, the association of theta band EROs at nine scalp locations in two experimental modalities and 21 SNPs at 131 age centers (ages 12 through 25 at 0.1 year intervals) were calculated. This provides effect size matrices of size 36 &#x000d7; 21 for each age center. The methods used to obtain the results are described in detail in <xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">Chorlian et al.

The study by <xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">Stead et al. (2006)</xref> of brain development in the male rat provides an exemplary model for comparison. The primary correspondence is between the gene expression levels in <xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">Stead et al. (2006)</xref> and the effect sizes in this study. Although effect sizes are signed and gene expression levels always positive, in gene expression studies measures of the difference from the mean are often the feature of interest. Trajectories of gene expression are shown in <xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">Stead et al. (2006</xref>, <xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>) and PCA plots in <xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">Stead et al. (2006</xref>, <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>). While a single PCA in <xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">Stead et al.

The specific statistical methods described here are meant to deal with the situation of using a relatively small number of candidate SNPs with a possibly large age and phenotypic variation in effect sizes and phenotypes with a wide but overwhelmingly positive range of correlations.</p></sec><sec id="S21"><label>8.2</label><title>Analysis of Association Trajectories</title><p id="P33">Extending a previous study of the development of theta band EROs (<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">Chorlian et al., 2015</xref>) and as used in <xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">Chorlian et al. (2017)</xref>, the model includes a genotypic value and a sex &#x000d7; genotype interaction, consistent with other studies of human development (<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">Wid&#x000e9;n et al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">Cousminer et al., 2013</xref>). Weights for individuals in the local linear regression model were adjusted to account for multiple observations on single individuals and co-presence of sibs in each of the regression calculations. The bandwidth for the kernel (Epanechnikov) was taken as 0.6 to minimize the mean squared error, although the variation in the size of the error was less than 2% over the range of bandwidths from 0.4 to 0.8.</p><p id="P34">In this study, the primary object of the analyses are the effect sizes of the SNPs obtained from the non-parametric regression calculations, although the <italic toggle="yes">p</italic>-values associated with these SNPs are also considered. The use of 21 SNPs and 18 phenotypes with separate effect sizes for males and females at 131 age centers produces 99036 effect size values. Effect sizes, unlike <italic toggle="yes">p</italic>-values, provide signed values which enable the direction of effect to be analyzed, and thus to more precisely characterize SNPs which have sex-specific and modality-specific effects. Effect sizes also are appropriately signed and scaled for covariance estimation, a key part of the analysis. The use of effect sizes also enables comparison between the results of this study and other studies which use different methodologies and have different sample sizes. In addition, arithmetic operations on effect sizes are easily interpreted, which is not the case with <italic toggle="yes">p</italic>-values.</p><p id="P35">As there are 5912 observations spread over a 13 year age-range, there is sufficient data to provide estimates of the means of the variables at one-tenth year intervals and to provide estimates of the mean rates of change of the variables as well. Since 90% of the successive observations of individuals have an interval of greater than 1.75 years, no longitudinal modeling at the shorter time scale (6 months) at which significant changes in the measured variables can occur is possible. (The estimate for the time scale is derived from <xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">Sullivan et al. (2011)</xref>). Results are not independent between models for different ages since the data in each of the 131 regression models has considerable overlap with the data used in the models for nearby ages. Significance levels and effect sizes were obtained from the regression calculations and corroborated using a non-parametric bootstrap method with 1000 resamplings. The bootstrapping process is described in <xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">Chorlian et al. (2017</xref>, p. 28). The regression method used in the calculation of the genotypic effect on the trajectories has the power to reliably detect effect sizes of greater than 0.1 based on the large number of subjects and observations included in the calculations of each parameter. Effect sizes of the major allele of significant SNPs typical of GWAS results in <xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">Kang et al. (2012)</xref> are of absolute value between 0.1 and 0.2.</p></sec><sec id="S22"><label>8.3</label><title>Identification of significant SNPs</title><p id="P36">To characterize the age specific variation of genotypic effects on the phenotypic variables, significant SNPs are identified on an SNP specific basis. Two complementary methods are used, estimation of the false discovery rate using the method outlined in <xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">Storey and Tibshirani (2003)</xref>, and the assessment of the concentration of effect sizes in particular SNPs. Although SNPs were selected on the basis of a likely involvement in the developmental process, it is not expected that all SNPs will be equally significant. Rather it is expected that significant effect sizes are concentrated in a relatively small number of SNP-phenotype combinations, since phenotypes are highly correlated across scalp electrodes for each sex-modality-age combination. Lack of concentration would suggest many of the large effect sizes (corresponding to low <italic toggle="yes">p</italic>-values) are the result of large random variation of effects across age and phenotype, and do not represent biologically stable phenomena. Concentration of effect is established by permutation tests which compare the realized distribution of effect sizes across SNP-phenotype combinations with the distribution of effect sizes of hypothetical random distributions of the realized effect sizes.</p><sec id="S23"><label>8.3.1</label><title>Significant SNPs identified by thresholding p-values by false discovery rate</title><p id="P37">The evaluation of the significance of the association of the individual SNPs with theta EROs is determined by the selection of individual <italic toggle="yes">p</italic>-values based on control of the false discovery rate. Given the fact that this is a candidate gene study, in which at least a small proportion of the tested variables are expected to be significant, the control of the false discovery rate by the characteristics of data is appropriate. The method used to determine the false discovery rate for any particular level of <italic toggle="yes">p</italic>-value must be capable of dealing with correlated data, as <italic toggle="yes">p</italic>-values are correlated as a result of both the non-parametric regression method and the phenotypic correlations described in <xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">Chorlian et al. (2015)</xref>. The method used is derived from that in <xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">Storey and Tibshirani (2003)</xref>, which uses the distribution of the calculated <italic toggle="yes">p</italic>-values to determine the prevalence of results which reflect the absence of association, and correspondingly, the prevalence of results which reflect the presence of association.</p><p id="P38">Specifically, the distribution of <italic toggle="yes">p</italic>-values from non-associated SNP-phenotype pairs should be uniform on the interval from 0 to 1, while the the distribution of <italic toggle="yes">p</italic>-values from associated SNP-phenotype pairs should be concentrated near 0. From the estimation of the occurrence of non-associated SNP-phenotype pairs, it is possible to estimate the occurrence of associated SNP-phenotype pairs, and determine the false discovery rate, sometimes called a <italic toggle="yes">q</italic>-value, as a function of thresholding at different <italic toggle="yes">p</italic>-values. As with any thresholding technique, choice of a threshold is arbitrary, and the correspondence between <italic toggle="yes">p</italic>-values and <italic toggle="yes">q</italic>-values for levels <italic toggle="yes">q</italic> &#x0003c; .05 and <italic toggle="yes">q</italic> &#x0003c; .01 are determined. This procedure is appropriate for the evaluation of all obtained <italic toggle="yes">p</italic>-values collectively, as the algorithm deals with correlated values appropriately. This provides information on a fine-grained time scale. (The part of the original algorithm in <xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">Storey and Tibshirani (2003)</xref> which estimates the proportion of the non-associated results was modified to deal more robustly with truncated <italic toggle="yes">p</italic>-value distributions when necessary, and provides a somewhat more conservative estimate than does the original).</p><p id="P39">In the interest of condensation of information and ease of interpretation, as well as the expectation that meaningful biological processes must extend over more than the length of a year, results are provided for 7 overlapping 3 year age ranges extending from age 12 to 24.

Medians of <italic toggle="yes">p</italic>-values across the age-ranges and the four phenotype groups were calculated to provide coarse-grained results. The concentration of measure of the range of <italic toggle="yes">p</italic>-values introduced by use of the median was considerable, particularly in the range 0 &#x0003c; <italic toggle="yes">p</italic> &#x0003c; 10<sup>&#x02212;2</sup> and introduced a corresponding bias in the direct application of the Storey-Tibshirani algorithm. As a consequence, the false discovery <italic toggle="yes">proportion</italic> threshold derived from the calculation on the raw <italic toggle="yes">p</italic>-values was used to determine the appropriate threshold for the control of the false discovery rate in the median <italic toggle="yes">p</italic>-values. A similar strategy is used to identify SNPs which had significant <italic toggle="yes">differential</italic> effect between sexes.</p></sec><sec id="S24"><label>8.3.2</label><title>Significant SNPs identified by concentration of effect sizes</title><p id="P40">To determine whether large effect sizes were distributed randomly across SNPs for sets of correlated phenotypes or concentrated in relatively few SNPs, the distribution of observed concentrations were tested against the hypothesis that there were no SNP-specific concentrations by a permutation test. The emphasis on SNPs is achieved by aggregating values across locations on the scalp, since phenotypic values are highly correlated over scalp locations.</p><p id="P41">As was done for the <italic toggle="yes">p</italic>-values, to simplify the analysis of age variation in the association trajectories, the absolute values of the 131 age-specific effect sizes for each SNP-phenotype pairing were averaged into 7 age-ranges of three years duration overlapping by one and one half years covering ages 12&#x02013;24. The same procedure was applied to the absolute value of the difference between effect sizes for males and females for corresponding modality-locality-SNP combinations, The averaging procedure was in part adopted to ensure that the values represented biologically meaningful phenomena and were not the result of random short-term fluctuations in the data.</p><p id="P42">In order to identify the significant SNPs, the values of the age-range averaged absolute effect sizes for each SNP were averaged over the 9 electrodes for each of the 4 sex-modality combinations, resulting in 4 averages from each of the seven age ranges for each SNP for the observed data. This provides 147 (21 SNPs &#x000d7; 7 age-ranges) SNP-age range effect sizes for each of the 4 sex-modality combinations. Given the generally high correlation between the theta EROs at the 9 electrodes (all correlations greater than 0.5, fewer than 3% less than 0.6), this is an additional method of reducing the effect of spurious large effect sizes on the identification of significant SNPs.</p><p id="P43">Permutation tests were carried out to test the null hypothesis that the distribution of the averaged absolute value of effect size values was not SNP-specific, that is, that a random distribution of the observed effect sizes among SNPs could account for the observed variability of effect sizes among SNP. To characterize the null hypothesis, the absolute values of the effect sizes from different SNPs were used when the averaging over the electrodes to create values for &#x0201c;pseudo&#x0201d;-SNPs in a manner similar to the averaging over the actual SNPs described in the previous paragraph. Since the data contains 21 SNPs, 21 pseudo-SNPs were created for each permutation calculation. For each pseudo-SNP, the average of the effect sizes over the 9 electrodes is not from a single SNP but from 9 different SNPs, no combination of which is repeated among the 21 pseudo-SNPs. That is, 9 distinct permutations of the effect sizes of the 21 SNPs are produced, one for each electrode, resulting in a matrix of 9 &#x000d7; 21 values for each sex-modality-age combination. Then the effect sizes are averaged across electrodes for each of the 21 pseudo-SNPs created by the permutation process. This is done for each sex-modality combination, resulting in 4 averages from each of the seven age ranges for each pseudo-SNP for the observed data. Randomly permuting the SNPs contributing to the averaging across the electrodes ensures that the effect sizes from all the SNPs are used. Each permutation procedure instance produces the same number of random groups of values for pseudo-SNPs as is produced for the actual SNPs. No permutations of age or phenotype are performed in order to preserve the covariance of those items from the original calculation. A large number (1000) of permutation sets were calculated, and for each of the seven age ranges, the mean and standard deviations over all the pseudo-SNPs in each of the permutation procedures are calculated to provide the statistical properties associated with the null hypothesis. It should be noted that the permutation test results for any one SNP-age-sex-phenotype combination, unlike the actual effect sizes, is a function of the effect sizes of all the other SNPs for that age-sex-phenotype combination, and thus reflect medium scale characteristics of the genotypic effects of the cholinergic system SNPs. For each of the actual SNPs the difference between the means over age ranges of the mean effect sizes of SNPs and the group mean of the pseudo-SNPs for the corresponding age ranges measured in standard deviations of the pseudo-SNPs values is obtained. The significance of the value for the actual SNPs is evaluated by a z-test.</p><p id="P44">The permutation tests are scale-free, and their use to identify important SNPs depends upon the absolute values of the effect sizes themselves. Thus some effect size thresholding is necessary to make this method useful for identifying significant SNPs; conversely, if all effect sizes are significantly large, then the method is superfluous. The averaging procedure serves to reduce the variance of the aggregated data, and combined with information from bootstrapping, ensures the reliability of the effect size estimates, whose importance can be gauged from the results of other genetic studies. We note that effect sizes of the major allele of significant SNPs typical of GWAS results in <xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">Kang et al. (2012)</xref> are of absolute value between 0.1 and 0.2. In the particular distribution of effect sizes obtained in this study, the method confirmed, that except for a single SNP, a threshold of .15 in effect size would correspond to a threshold of 10<sup>&#x02212;4</sup> in p-value, as shown in the top panel of <xref rid="F7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>.</p><p id="P45">Absolute values of effect sizes follow a folded normal distribution with variance 0.0025 corresponding to a normal distribution with variance 0.0069. However mean effect sizes averaged across correlated phenotypes and 3 year age ranges are neither uniformly nor normally distributed across SNPs as shown by the permutation test results. The distribution of the permutation test results, expressed in terms of z-scores, are not symmetrical but have a peak at about &#x02212;2 standard deviations and a long rightward tail beginning about +2 standard deviations above the mean as shown in <xref rid="F8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8</xref>. The fraction of effect sizes less than .1 among the SNP-age-phenotype combinations selected by having permutation scores greater than the inverse normal cdf determined by <italic toggle="yes">p</italic>-values in the range .05 to 10<sup>&#x02212;4</sup> was linearly related to the logarithm of the p-value, decreasing from about 30% for <italic toggle="yes">p</italic> = .05 to 15% for <italic toggle="yes">p</italic> = 10<sup>&#x02212;4</sup>. For <italic toggle="yes">p</italic> &#x0003c; 10<sup>&#x02212;4</sup>, the rate of decrease diminished from the rate over the range of .05 to 10<sup>&#x02212;4</sup>. Further observation of the distribution suggests that the SNP-age combinations fall into three groups, non-significant, null, and significant.</p><p id="P46">Any selection of SNP-age-phenotype combinations by thresholding of permutation scores will result in effect sizes specific to individual phenotypes which are less than 0.1 (or comparable value) being included in the select group, and effect sizes which are greater than 0.1 excluded from the select group. The exclusions are justified on the basis that they represent either sporadic occurrences over age and phenotype and therefore not of biological interest or else false positives; the inclusions reflect genetic heterogeneity in scalp localization in which large effect sizes in one region will counterbalance smaller effect sizes in other regions. Determination of the significance level for the <italic toggle="yes">p</italic>-values associated with the SNP-age combinations from the permutation was made by adapting the method of <xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">Storey and Tibshirani (2003)</xref> to determine the <italic toggle="yes">q</italic>-value (false discovery rate associated with the particular <italic toggle="yes">p</italic>-value), and establish the false discovery rate corresponding, if somewhat indirectly, to setting a threshold for effect sizes.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S25"><label>8.4</label><title>Identification of SNPs contributing to Phenotypic Variance</title><p id="P47">Principal component analysis was not applied to the data set corresponding to the entire age range because the use of PCA on the individual age ranges revealed that the first components varied considerably across the age ranges. Application of PCA to the entire age range would have identified components which were only remotely interpretable compared to the components identified in the individual age ranges. Instead the seven data sets consisting of the effect sizes for individual phenotypes as determined by the age range averaging described in <xref rid="S24" ref-type="sec">section 8.3.2</xref> were used in the analysis.</p></sec><sec id="S26"><label>8.5</label><title>Analysis of sPCA results</title><p id="P48">Sparse principal component analysis (sPCA) was used to determine genotypic profiles which discriminated between modalities and sexes. In contrast to the tests for significant SNPs, sPCA identifies only individual SNPs which have differential effects between sexes, modalities, or localities. Parameters for sparseness were two components with no more than 10 SNPs per component applied to the aggregated effect sizes described in <xref rid="S24" ref-type="sec">section 8.3.2</xref>. Given the restriction of 10 SNPs in each component, two-thirds of the 147 SNP-age range combinations never appear in the first component. This is the non-significant group for determining the empirical null distribution. The significance of the members of the group non-zero components are evaluated based on the empirical null distribution. The same sPCA analysis was applied to the 1000 bootstrap samples described in <xref rid="S21" ref-type="sec">section 8.2</xref> and the proportion of occurrence of each of the 147 SNP-age range combinations in the first sPCA component of the 1000 bootstrap samples determined, as well as the frequency of occurrence of the significant and non-significant SNP-age range combinations from the actual sample. The 95th percentile of cumulative distribution function of the fraction of the occurrences of each of the members of the 99 members non-significant group in the sparse PCA across the bootstrap sample acts as the criterion for significance at the .05 level; every snp-age range combination which occurs in a greater fraction of bootstrap instances than that of the significance criterion is found to be significant.
