However, in patients with autoimmune diseases such as multiple sclerosis (MS), Treg fail to control the autoreactive immune response central to their pathology. Although the frequency of circulating Treg is not different in MS patients compared to healthy controls, patient-derived Treg exhibit loss of <italic toggle="yes">in vitro</italic> function, as well as impaired FOXP3 expression levels<sup><xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup>. Moreover, numbers of Treg within MS lesions have been reported to be low or non-existing, despite the presence of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell infiltrates<sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup>. This suggests that factors that regulate local Treg homeostasis and function may contribute to the loss of tolerance central to autoimmune conditions.</p><p id="P14">One factor that governs Treg homeostasis is the cytokine interleukin 2 (IL-2).

We have performed these studies in the experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) mouse model of multiple sclerosis, a setting where IL-2 and FOXP3<sup>+</sup> Treg are known to modulate disease severity<sup><xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup>. Our data reveal a previously unsuspected role for the tissue microenvironment in the regulation of Treg homeostasis and immune tolerance.</p><sec id="S1"><title>IL-2 is bound to HS in EAE lesions</title><p id="P17">To explore the role of HS in autoimmune neuroinflammation, we asked whether IL-2 and HS are present at sites of inflammation in C57Bl/6/MOG<sub>35&#x02013;55</sub> -induced EAE. We first characterized the distribution of both IL-2 and HS in spinal cord tissue from na&#x000ef;ve (healthy) and EAE animals. We observed that na&#x000ef;ve spinal cord tissue has scattered IL-2 staining. This staining is not associated with HS staining, which is found mostly in vasculature and meninges (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a</xref>). In contrast, spinal cord tissue from EAE mice shows increased IL-2 staining throughout areas of parenchymal inflammation, as well as increased HS deposition (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a</xref>,<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">b</xref>). Both IL-2 and HS staining were found on cellular structures with astroglial morphology (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Extended Data Fig. 1</xref>, arrows), and in the form of diffuse staining in between cellular structures, suggesting association with peri- and extracellular matrix (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Extended Data Fig. 1</xref>, asterisks). HS staining was also seen associated with some CD45 cells, both in perivascular spaces, as well as infiltrated into the CNS parenchyma. However, these cells generally did not stain positive for IL-2 (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Extended Data Fig. 1</xref>, arrowheads). Staining for glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), which stains the cytosekeleton of astrocytes, revealed that indeed, much of the cellular pattern of IL-2 and HS staining overlapped, or was directly adjacent to, GFAP+ structures, indicating that IL-2/HS deposition in EAE lesions is associated with reactive astrocytes (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Extended Data Figs. 2</xref> and <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">3</xref>).</p><p id="P18">We then quantified the abundance and colocalization of IL-2 and HS throughout the course of EAE, using Imaris software. We observed that IL-2 staining was significantly increased in areas with CD45<sup>+</sup> leukocyte infiltration (lesions), at the late acute stage of disease (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1c</xref>). HS was markedly increased in these areas as well, but also in areas adjacent to lesions (perilesion) and the glia limitans underlying the meninges, at the chronic stage of disease (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1c</xref>). This gradual increase correlated with the colocalization of IL-2 with HS, which was significantly increased in lesion, as well as perilesion areas at late acute and chronic stages (the percentage of Il-2 that is colocalized with HS ranging from 60 to 80%; <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1c</xref>). These analyses show that both the abundance of HS and IL-2 increase over the disease course of EAE and that these co-localize extensively.</p><p id="P19">To determine whether the deposition of IL-2 deposition in inflammatory areas depends on its interaction with HS, we enzymatically removed HS structures using heparinase and subsequently assessed the presence of both IL-2 and HS in the treated tissue. We found that heparinase treatment not only removes HS from the tissue, but also reduces IL-2 immunostaining where it overlaps with HS (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1d</xref>), suggesting that IL-2 binds to HS in EAE lesions. Together, these data indicate that IL-2 is present and bound to HS at sites of autoimmune neuroinflammation.</p></sec><sec id="S2"><title>Binding to HS fragments increases IL-2 potency</title><p id="P20">We next asked whether binding to HS impacts the function of IL-2. We found that pre-incubation with soluble HS enhances the bioactivity of IL-2 as measured by CTLL2 proliferation (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2a</xref>). To specifically interrogate the role of the HS-binding capacity of IL-2 in this potentiating effect, we used a mutant of IL-2, T51P-IL-2, which contains a single point mutation in the HS binding domain of IL-2 that significantly decreases its ability to bind HS but leaves its soluble bioactivity intact<sup><xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup>. Soluble IL-2 and soluble T51P-IL-2 have comparable effects on CTLL2 proliferation (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Extended Data Fig. 4a</xref>). However, pre-incubation of IL-2 with soluble HS enhances its biological efficacy 4- to 100-fold, with only modest effects on T51P-IL-2 (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Extended Data Fig. 4b</xref>). These data demonstrate that binding to soluble HS amplifies the bioactive potency of IL-2.</p><p id="P21">To better assess the binding of IL-2 to HS and the biological implications of this binding, we coated magnetic beads with heparin, which is chemically identical to HS and only differs in the level of sulfation<sup><xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup>. We then loaded these beads with increasing concentrations of IL-2 and T51P-IL-2 and washed off any unbound cytokine (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Extended Data Fig. 5</xref>). Using CTLL2 cell proliferation as a read-out (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2b</xref>), we compared the efficacy of IL-2- and T51P-IL-2-loaded beads to that of soluble IL-2 and T51P-IL-2. We found that heparin-coated beads loaded with IL-2 deliver biologically active cytokine in a dose-dependent fashion, whereas the effective dose delivered by T51P-IL-2-loaded beads is much lower (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2a</xref> and <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Extended Data Fig. 4c</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S3"><title>Treg utilize HS-bound IL-2 for homeostasis</title><p id="P22">Using FOXP3.GFP reporter mice, we next evaluated the impact of binding to HS on the ability of IL-2 to support <italic toggle="yes">in vitro</italic> homeostasis of CD4<sup>+</sup>FOXP3<sup>+</sup> Treg. We first observed that pre-incubation of IL-2 with HS enhances its support of the survival and FOXP3 expression of <italic toggle="yes">in vitro</italic> induced Treg (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2d</xref>). Next, we used a competitive setting to compare the usage of HS-bound IL-2 between freshly isolated CD4<sup>+</sup>FOXP3<sup>+</sup> Treg and CD4<sup>+</sup>FOXP3<sup>&#x02212;</sup> Tconv, using our heparin-coated beads (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2e</xref>). We found that beads incubated with IL-2, but not T51P-IL-2, support <italic toggle="yes">in vitro</italic> survival of FOXP3<sup>+</sup> Treg in a dose dependent manner, although the effect on FOXP3 expression did not reach statistical significance (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2f</xref>). We speculate that GFP protein may persist in cells as a &#x0201c;lagging indicator&#x0201d; of Treg homeostasis. In contrast, the viability of FOXP3<sup>&#x02212;</sup> Tconv was not affected by either IL-2 or T51P-IL-2-loaded heparin beads, regardless of whether they expressed the IL-2 receptor CD25<sup>+</sup> or not (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2g</xref>).</p><p id="P23">To test whether Treg &#x0201c;strip&#x0201d; IL-2 from heparin-coated beads, we co-incubated Treg with heparin-coated beads that were pre-incubated with either IL-2 or T51P-IL-2. We then separated these beads from the Treg and subsequently co-incubated them with CTLL2 cells. By assessing the proliferative response induced by these beads we inferred how much IL-2 remained bound to these beads (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2h</xref>). As before, we found that IL-2-loaded beads, but not T51P-IL-2-loaded beads, induce proliferation of CTLL2 cells (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2i</xref>). However, beads that were previously co-incubated with Treg promoted far less proliferation, indicating that Treg are able to remove IL-2 bound to heparin. Together, these data indicate that Treg, but not Tconv, use exogenous, HS-bound IL-2 to support their homeostasis. Moreover, these data suggest that Treg actively &#x0201c;strip&#x0201d; IL-2 that is bound to sequestered HS.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Treg express higher levels of HPSE than Tconv</title><p id="P24">The data above suggest that Treg may actively engage HS-containing structures to access bound IL-2.

We observed the same pattern in both HPSE<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup>.FOXP3.GFP on the C57Bl/6 background, as well as mice crossed with C57Bl/6 10BiT reporter mice from a different institution<sup><xref rid="R48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref></sup> (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Extended Data Fig. 7d</xref>). Consistent with this, FOXP3<sup>+</sup> Treg frequencies are reduced in secondary lymphoid tissue of HPSE<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice, but not in other tissues, including thymus, and the blood (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4i</xref>). Of note, the number and distribution of cytokine-producing CD4<sup>+</sup> T helper cell subsets is not altered in lymphoid tissue of HPSE<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Extended Data Fig. 7e</xref>), indicating that these effects are specific to Treg. Moreover, whereas the frequency of FOXP3<sup>+</sup> Treg increases with age in wild type (WT) mice<sup><xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></sup>, in HPSE<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice, this aging-related increase in Treg frequency is significantly reduced (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Extended Data Fig. 7f</xref>). Together, these data suggest that Treg homeostasis is impaired in the absence of HPSE.</p><p id="P31">To test whether the effect of HPSE expression on the homeostasis of Treg is cell intrinsic, we performed two competitive transfer experiments. First, we generated mixed bone marrow chimeras using congenic (CD45.1<sup>+</sup>) WT and (CD45.2<sup>+</sup>) HPSE<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> donors and assessed the frequency of FOXP3<sup>+</sup> Treg among donor-derived cells in lymphoid tissue of CD45.1/2 recipients (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4j</xref>). This revealed that Treg frequencies were significantly lower among CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells derived from HPSE<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> donor cells than those derived from WT donor cells in recipient secondary lymphoid tissue, but not the thymus (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4k</xref>,<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">l</xref>).</p><p id="P32">Additionally, we FACS-sorted FOXP3<sup>+</sup> Treg from CD45.1<sup>+</sup> WT and CD45.2<sup>+</sup> HPSE<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> donor mice, both on the CD90.2 background, and adoptively transferred these cells into congenic CD90.1 recipient mice (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4m</xref>). Seven days post-transfer, the frequency of HPSE<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> donor-derived cells among transferred FOXP3<sup>+</sup> Treg was significantly lower than that of WT donor-derived cells in both spleen and lymph node tissue (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4n</xref>,<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">o</xref>).</p><p id="P33">Together, these data indicate that the impairment seen in HPSE<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> Treg homeostasis is intrinsic to hematopoietic cells. Moreover, our transfer studies with purified Treg establish that these effects have specific relevance to these cells in this model system.</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>HPSE expression enables FOXP3<sup>+</sup> Treg to access tissue-bound IL-2</title><p id="P34">Considering our observation that overlapping IL-2 and HS staining in EAE lesions appears to be astrocyte-associated (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Extended Data Fig. 2</xref> and <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">3</xref>), we next questioned whether Treg are capable of accessing IL-2 that is associated with astrocytes and whether HPSE is necessary for this. To test this, we pre-incubated confluent cultures of the astroglioma cell line U87-MG, which express HSPG on their cell surface<sup><xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></sup>, with IL-2. After washing off any unbound IL-2, we co-cultured these with freshly isolated CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells from WT and HPSE<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5a</xref>). We found that FOXP3<sup>+</sup> Treg only survive in co-cultures with astrocytes when they have been pre-incubated with IL-2 and that this survival is significantly reduced in HPSE<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> Treg compared to WT Treg (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5b</xref>). In contrast, the survival of CD25<sup>+</sup> Tconv was much lower in these co-cultures and is not affected by HPSE expression (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>,<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">c</xref>). Of note, the survival of CD25<sup>&#x02212;</sup> Tconv was supported by astrocyte cultures and is affected by HPSE expression to a small extent. However, this effect is not dependent on IL-2 (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Extended Data Fig. 8a</xref>).</p><p id="P35">We also tested whether Treg are capable of utilizing IL-2 associated with CNS tissue. To this end, we pre-incubated homogenized spinal cord tissue from healthy mice with IL-2 and, after washing off unbound IL-2, co-cultured this with CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells. Using these preparations, we observed that IL-2 pre-incubated spinal cord tissue supports the survival of WT Treg in an IL-2 dose-dependent manner and that this is significantly reduced in HPSE<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> Treg (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5d</xref>). Neither CD25<sup>+</sup> nor CD25<sup>&#x02212;</sup> Tconv survival is enhanced by IL-2 pre-incubation of spinal cord tissue and does not depend on HPSE (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5e</xref> and <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Extended Data Fig. 8b</xref>). Consistent with this, HPSE-overexpressing CTLL2 cells are also able to proliferate, in a dose-dependent manner, in response to spinal cord tissue pre-incubated with IL-2, but not in response to T51P-IL-2 pre-incubated spinal cord tissue (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Extended Data Fig. 8c</xref>,<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">d</xref>).

This reduced disease severity is mainly due to a higher recovery rate (more animals converting to a lower disease score) in mice that received WT Treg than in mice that either received HPSE<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> or no Treg (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Extended Data Fig. 8f</xref>), consistent with the notion that Treg are involved in the recovery of EAE<sup><xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref></sup>.This treatment effect was correlated with a change in the distribution of immune cells infiltrating the spinal cord of these mice, as assessed by flow cytometry (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Extended Data Fig. 8g</xref>,<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">h</xref>).

For this, we used the flexible mAb-directed CAR clone 1X9Q, which contains an anti-FITC scFv portion fused to CD28 and CD3&#x003b6; costimulatory domains<sup><xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref></sup>, and fused the expression sequence of HPSE to this construct, as a proof-of-concept (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Extended Data Fig. 9a</xref>). We first transfected mRNA produced from these constructs into CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells from WT C57Bl/6 mice, resulting in high transfection efficiency for both constructs (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Extended Data Fig. 9b</xref>). When cultured with IL-2-loaded heparin-beads, we observed that persistence of FOXP3<sup>+</sup> cells is marginally, but significantly, higher among these HPSE overexpressing CAR T cells than control CAR T cells (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Extended Data Fig. 9c</xref> and Fig 6i). Moreover, cultured HPSE overexpressing CAR Treg have higher expression of not only FOXP3, but also the functional Treg markers CTLA-4 and PD-1 (Fig. 6j). Similarly, when CD45.1 FOXP3<sup>+</sup> HPSE overexpressing CAR Treg were adoptively transferred into CD45.2 mice and recovered 3 days later, they exhibited slightly increased FOXP3 and co-inhibitory marker expression (Fig. 6l and <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Extended Data Fig. 9d</xref>,<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">e</xref>). Finally, we targeted HPSE overexpressing CAR Treg towards myelin by incubating them with a FITC-conjugated monoclonal antibody against MOG, before transferring them into EAE animals and testing their ability to suppress disease. Transferring these MOG-specific CAR Treg into mice at peak EAE revealed that overexpression of HPSE increased their ability to reduce disease severity compared to control CAR Treg (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Extended Data Fig. 9f</xref> and Fig. 6k). Together, these data suggest that the expression of HPSE enhances the phenotypic stability and function of CAR Treg.</p></sec><sec id="S10"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P40">In this study, we have examined how FOXP3<sup>+</sup> Treg obtain IL-2 at sites of autoimmune neuroinflammation. We report that IL-2 is sequestered by HS within the ECM and that FOXP3<sup>+</sup> Treg use HPSE to access this essential resource to sustain their survival and function <italic toggle="yes">in vivo</italic>. In this way, ECM-bound IL-2, sequestered within tissues at sites of inflammation, may sustain regulatory responses in post-inflammatory settings. This mechanism may be particularly important in preventing and/or resolving autoimmunity, where Treg survival and function are critical for the maintenance of immune homeostasis.</p><p id="P41">Our finding suggest that tissue interactions are vital to the effects of IL-2 on Treg. Binding to soluble HS fragments, which could be generated locally <italic toggle="yes">in vivo</italic> due to cleavage of ECM HS chains by HPSE, enhances the biological effect of IL-2 on both FOXP3<sup>+</sup> Treg and CTLL2 cells, a T cell line exquisitely dependent on exogenous IL-2. Consistent with these effects, HS was reported to potentiate the effects of IL-2 on Tconv proliferation<sup><xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup>. HS similarly potentiates the impact of other cytokines; HS-binding of IL-12 significantly reduces the EC<sub>50</sub> of this cytokine by acting as a co-receptor which enhances interactions between IL-12 and its receptor subunits<sup><xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref></sup>. In light of this potentiating effect of HS, and given the low levels of soluble IL-2 levels in blood, cerebrospinal fluid, and other fluids<sup><xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup>, HS-bound IL-2, liberated by HPSE, may provide a critical source of support for Treg homeostasis <italic toggle="yes">in vivo</italic>. To be clear, we do not claim that all IL-2 is associated with HS. Rather, we propose that by influencing the spatial and temporal properties of IL-2 in tissues, the ECM is a partner in local immune homeostasis. These findings have clear implications for IL-2 as a therapeutic in autoimmunity and other inflammatory settings, and may inform future endeavors to design synthetic IL-2 or low-dose IL-2 treatment protocols, which have shown much promise in clinical trials<sup><xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P42">Competition for IL-2 is one of the mechanisms by which Treg suppress T-cell responses<sup><xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref></sup>. Therefore, the differential HPSE expression between Treg and Tconv may provide Treg with a competitive edge over effector T cells at sites of inflammation, where much of IL-2 is sequestered to HS in the ECM. Consistent with this, HPSE expression does not appear to be a benefit to Tconv, but rather play a critical role in Treg homeostasis and function.</p><p id="P43">The source of IL-2 in the CNS in the EAE model may be astrocytes given the colocalization of IL-2 with GFAP+ astrocytes in lesions. Consistent with this, astrocytes are reported to be able to produce both IL-2 and HS<sup><xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="R45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref></sup>. However, T cells, neurons and other cell types can also produce IL-2 and make contribute to the presence of IL-2 in these environments.</p><p id="P44">In this work, we have focused our efforts on targeted Treg studies, because of the complex phenotypes associated with systemic loss or inhibition of HPSE. However, HPSE is expressed by other cell types, including innate and adaptive immune cells<sup><xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="R48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>,<xref rid="R49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref></sup> and may impact these cells in distinct ways. Future studies will interrogate these connections. Likewise, distinct effects of HPSE on different cell types may underlie the conflicting data on HPSE inhibitors, some of which also have bioactivity independent of effects on HPSE<sup><xref rid="R50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref></sup>. Several such small molecules are promising therapies in cancer<sup><xref rid="R51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref></sup> while at least one was shown to worsen EAE<sup><xref rid="R52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref></sup>. It has also been shown that administration of exogenous HPSE reduces disease in EAE and increases the production of anti-inflammatory cytokines by T cells<sup><xref rid="R53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref></sup>. Overall, studies on the role of HPSE in MS and EAE are limited and challenging to interpret, given the multiple cell types and tissues involved. Further in-depth studies involving cell- and tissue-specific approaches are warranted to fully uncover the role of HPSE in MS.</p><p id="P45">Building on the insights described here, we provide proof-of-principle data that (CAR) Treg engineered to express HPSE are better able to utilize HS-bound IL-2 and have enhanced phenotypic stability <italic toggle="yes">in vitro</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">in vivo</italic>. MOG-specific CAR Tregs have previously been shown to diminish disease severity in EAE upon intranasal transfer<sup><xref rid="R54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref></sup>. The results we present here demonstrate the promise of considering the cell-ECM interphase in attempts to enhance the function of (CAR) Treg based therapies.</p><p id="P46">To conclude, we demonstrate that IL-2 is sequestered by HS at sites of autoimmune inflammation, that HS-bound IL-2 promotes FOXP3<sup>+</sup> Treg survival and function, and that Treg require HPSE to access this essential resource. These interactions resolve a critical gap in our understanding of Treg homeostasis and function <italic toggle="yes">in vivo</italic>.
