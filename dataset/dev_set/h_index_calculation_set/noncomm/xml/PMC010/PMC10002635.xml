To do so, they must polarize within the epithelial plane at both the individual and tissue scales. At the individual scale, cells polarize along a leading-trailing axis. Protrusion and adhesion formation are biased to cells&#x02019; leading edges, and contractility and adhesion removal to their trailing edges, much as in cells migrating solo<sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup>. At the tissue scale, cells throughout the epithelium are polarized such that their leading edges preferentially point in the direction of migration, and trailing edges in the opposite direction, a form of planar cell polarity. At the intersection of these scales are the cell-cell interfaces that link the trailing edge of one cell to the leading edge of the cell behind. These leading-trailing interfaces can act as sites of biochemical or mechano-chemical signaling that polarize motility behaviors across the interface<sup><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> However, we know little about how the necessary signaling proteins become organized along these interfaces.</p><p id="P5">The rotational migration of the follicle cells in <italic toggle="yes">Drosophila melanogaster</italic> has proven to be a fruitful system for identifying signaling mechanisms that coordinate epithelial cell movements. Follicle cells are somatic cells of the egg chamber, the multicellular structure within the ovary that gives rise to an egg. They form a continuous monolayer epithelium around a central cluster of germ cells, and they are surrounded in turn by a basement membrane extracellular matrix that encapsulates the entire egg chamber. The follicle cells&#x02019; apical surfaces adhere to the germ cells, and their basal surfaces adhere to and crawl along the basement membrane<sup><xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup>. Migration in this topologically-closed configuration causes the entire egg chamber to rotate within the stationary basement membrane. This motion changes the basement membrane&#x02019;s structure, ultimately helping give the egg its elongated shape<sup><xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup>. Follicle cell migration requires WAVE complex-dependent lamellipodia, which are polarized to the leading edge of each cell and planar-polarized across the epithelium<sup><xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>,<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">B</xref>). Polarity emerges tissue-autonomously, without input from extrinsic directional cues. This simplifying feature allows us to more easily isolate the contribution of within-group coordination to collective migration. It likely also makes these cells particularly reliant on such coordination for movement.</p><p id="P6">Two biochemical signaling modules operate at leading-trailing interfaces, where they coordinate the migratory behaviors of neighboring follicle cells. The first module is composed of the atypical cadherin Fat2 and the receptor tyrosine phosphatase Leukocyte-antigen-related-like (Lar). Fat2 is enriched along the trailing edge of each cell, where it acts in trans to concentrate Lar and the WAVE complex across the cell-cell interface, at the leading edge of the cell behind<sup><xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup> (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref>,<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">D</xref>). Lar also contributes to WAVE complex localization, but not as strongly as Fat2, implying the existence of additional unidentified Fat2 effectors<sup><xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup>. Together, these proteins restrict cell protrusive activity to a single leading edge domain and orient all the cells&#x02019; protrusions in a uniform direction across the tissue<sup><xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup>. The second module is composed of a transmembrane semaphoring (ligand) and plexin( receptor) pair, Semaphorin 5c (Sema5c) and Plexin A (PlexA), which are enriched at leading and trailing edges respectively<sup><xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup> (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref>,<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">D</xref>). In other contexts, semaphorin-plexin signaling can lower integrin-based adhesion and/or inhibit protrusivity on the plexin-containing cell side<sup><xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup>. Similarly, overexpression of Sema5c in one follicle cell reduces the protrusivity of its neighbors in a PlexA-dependent manner<sup><xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup>. This led to the model that Sema5c signals through PlexA to maintain a non-protrusive state at cells&#x02019; trailing edges.</p><p id="P7">Despite their distinct depletion and overexpression phenotypes, several lines of evidence suggest that the Fat2-Lar and Sema5c-PlexA modules function within one interface-polarizing signaling system. A series of pairwise comparisons show that Fat2, Lar, and Sema5c all colocalize with the WAVE complex in interface-spanning puncta that sit at the tips of filopodia within a broader lamellipodium<sup><xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup> (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1E</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">I</xref>). For reasons that are not yet clear, PlexA only rarely colocalizes with the other proteins<sup><xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup>. Loss of Lar also reduces Sema5c&#x02019;s enrichment at leading edges, implying functional interaction between the two modules in addition to their shared spatial organization<sup><xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup>.. In this study, we investigated the hierarchy of interactions between Fat2, Lar, and Sema5c by which they form interface-spanning puncta, and asked how the three proteins work together to promote collective migration.</p><p id="P8">We found that Fat2 forms the core of both the Lar- and Sema5c-containing signaling modules. Trailing edge-enriched Fat2 concentrates both Lar and Sema5c at leading edges in trans and is continuously required for them to maintain this localization. Fat2 performs this function, at least in part, by slowing Lar&#x02019;s and likely Sema5c&#x02019;s turnover from the leading edge. We further found that Lar and Sema5c act in parallel to promote collective migration. From these data, we propose that Fat2 acts as a central organizer of follicle cells&#x02019; interface-polarizing signaling system, serving to couple and polarize the distributions of multiple effectors that together align the motility machinery of neighboring cells.</p></sec><sec id="S2"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Fat2 maintains both Lar and Sema5c&#x02019;s enrichment at leading edges</title><p id="P9">Fat2, Lar, and Sema5c all colocalize in interface-spanning puncta, with Fat2 at trailing edges and Lar and Sema5c at leading edges<sup><xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup>. Fat2 acts in trans to concentrate Lar at leading edges<sup><xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup>, a result we confirmed in this study using a new endogenous 3xGFP tag on Lar (Lar-3xGFP, <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figs. 2A</xref>,<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">B</xref>; <xref rid="SD4" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1</xref>). To ask if Fat2 has the same effect on Sema5c, we generated epithelia with mosaic expression of <italic toggle="yes">fat2</italic>-RNAi and measured Sema5c-3xGFP levels along leading-trailing interfaces. Sema5c levels were reduced wherever a <italic toggle="yes">fat2</italic>-RNAi cell was present ahead of the interface, regardless of the genotype of the cell behind the interface (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref>,<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">D</xref>), again indicating a local trans interaction. Since Lar also contributes to Sema5c&#x02019;s enrichment at leading edges<sup><xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup>, we asked if Fat2 localizes Sema5c indirectly through Lar. We confirmed that Sema5c levels were indeed reduced at leading-trailing interfaces between control cells and cells with a null <italic toggle="yes">lar</italic> allele (<italic toggle="yes">lar</italic><sup><italic toggle="yes">13.2</italic></sup>, <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2E</xref>,<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">F</xref>). However, this reduction was not as great as at interfaces between <italic toggle="yes">fat2</italic>-RNAi cells (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2G</xref>). We conclude that Fat2 acts in trans to concentrate Sema5c at leading edges at least partly independently of Lar (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2H</xref>).</p><p id="P10">We next asked whether Fat2 is continuously required for Lar and Sema5c&#x02019;s enrichment at leading edges,or whether it becomes dispensable after interface polarity is established. Because calcium ions are integral to the structure of cadherin extracellular domains<sup><xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup>, calcium removal should disrupt any Fat2 function that depends directly or indirectly on its extracellular domain. Treating egg chambers with the cell-impermeable calcium chelator ethylene glycol-O,O<sup>&#x02032;</sup>-bis(2-aminoethyl)-N,N,N<sup>&#x02032;</sup>,N<sup>&#x02032;</sup>-tetraacetic acid (EGTA,20mM) for five minutes reduced the levels of protrusion-associated F-actin (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>), consistent with loss of Fat2 function<sup><xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup> (compare to <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>,<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">C</xref>). It did not, however, cause other obvious changes to cell morphology, and protrusions returned within one hour after EGTA washout (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>), suggesting that this method rapidly and reversibly inhibits Fat2 without generally disrupting tissue architecture. Notably, the five minute EGTA treatment substantially reduced Lar and Sema5c levels along leading-trailing interfaces (Lar fluorescence intensity by 50%, Sema5c by 25%, <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B</xref>,<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">C</xref>). Fat2 levels were nearly unchanged after five minutes, but its distribution became even more punctate, and by 30 minutes of EGTA treatment its levels had substantially decreased (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">D</xref>). Thus, Fat2 is continuously required to maintain the enrichment of Lar and Sema5c at leading edges.</p><p id="P11">To probe the limits of Fat2&#x02019;s capacity to position the leading-edge proteins, we used GrabFP-A<sup>Int</sup> to create an ectopic Fat2 population<sup><xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup> (<xref rid="SD4" ref-type="supplementary-material">Fig. S2A</xref>), and asked if this could relocalize Lar. At present, we lack a functional Sema5c antibody, and so could not check for its relocalization. Fat2 and Lar normally colocalize in puncta at the basal surface and along tricellular junctions that span the apical-basal axis<sup><xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></sup>. Expression of GrabFP-A<sup>Int</sup> caused Fat2-3xGFP to accumulate all around adherens junctions as well, and increased Fat2-3xGFP levels overall (<xref rid="SD4" ref-type="supplementary-material">Fig. S2B</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="SD4" ref-type="supplementary-material">F</xref>). The ectopic Fat2 had no effect on the distribution of Lar, which remained restricted to tricellular junctions in the adherens junction plane despite Fat2&#x02019;s presence all around cell perimeters (<xref rid="SD4" ref-type="supplementary-material">Fig. S2D</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="SD4" ref-type="supplementary-material">F</xref>). These data show that Fat2 is limited in its ability to recruit Lar, and that there must be some other feature(s) of basal cell-cell interfaces and tricellular junctions that are required for Lar&#x02019;s enrichment and perhaps for puncta assembly in general.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Lar and Sema5c play only a minor role in the localization of Fat2</title><p id="P12">Given Fat2&#x02019;s importance for localizing Lar and Sema5c, we asked if they play a reciprocal role in localizing Fat2. To this end, we measured the average level of Fat2-3xGFP along all cell-cell interfaces at the basal surface of epithelia lackingLar (<italic toggle="yes">lar</italic>-RNAi), Sema5c(<italic toggle="yes">Sema5c</italic><sup><italic toggle="yes">K175</italic></sup>), or both proteins together (<italic toggle="yes">lar</italic>-RNAi,<italic toggle="yes">Sema5c</italic><sup><italic toggle="yes">K175</italic></sup>) and compared these values to control epithelia. Full basal cell perimeters were used instead of leading-trailing interfaces because Fat2 loses its planar polarization when migration is disrupted<sup><xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup>, as occurs in some of these backgrounds (see <xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>). Fat2 levels were normal in epithelia lacking Lar and mildly reduced in epithelia lacking Sema5c (<xref rid="SD4" ref-type="supplementary-material">Fig. S3A</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="SD4" ref-type="supplementary-material">C</xref>). Importantly, Fat2 levels were not further reduced in epithelia lacking both proteins compared to those lacking Sema5c alone (<xref rid="SD4" ref-type="supplementary-material">Fig. S3A</xref>,<xref rid="SD4" ref-type="supplementary-material">B</xref>). So, whereas Fat2 plays a major role in localizing Lar and Sema5c, Lar and Sema5c play at most a minor role in localizing Fat2 (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2H</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Slowly-exchanging Fat2 molecules decrease the turnover of the leading edge proteins</title><p id="P13">We hypothesized that Fat2&#x02019;s ability to concentrate Lar and Sema5c across their shared interface might be due to Fat2 slowing their turnover from cells&#x02019; leading edges. To test this idea, we first used fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) to measure the turnover rates of all three proteins along leading-trailing interfaces at the basal surface of control epithelia. Within 6 minutes after photobleaching, Fat2-3xGFP fluorescence had only recovered to 29% &#x000b1;10% of its initial levels, whereas Lar-3xGFP and Sema5c-3xGFP fluorescence had recovered to 70%&#x000b1;21% and 90%&#x000b1;26%, respectively (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">E</xref>; Movie 1). During a longer recovery period of 28 minutes, Fat2-3xGFP fluorescence increased to 59%&#x000b1;25% of initial levels, still lower than the maximum recovery seen for Lar and Sema5c (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4F</xref>,<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">G</xref>; Movie 2). These data show that Fat2 molecules reside at leading-trailing interfaces for tens of minutes, and Lar and Sema5c only minutes, under normal conditions.</p><p id="P14">We then asked if Fat2 regulates the turnover of Lar and Sema5c at interfaces by performing the same FRAP experiment in epithelia lacking Fat2. Indeed, recovery of Lar-3xGFP fluorescence was faster in <italic toggle="yes">fat2</italic><sup><italic toggle="yes">N103-2</italic></sup> epithelia than in control epithelia (time to &#x000bd; recovery: 34 sec in <italic toggle="yes">fat2</italic><sup><italic toggle="yes">N103-2</italic></sup>, 87 sec in control; <xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B</xref>,<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">D</xref>; Movie 1). The initial recovery of Sema5c-3xGFP was also slightly faster on average in the absence of Fat2 (time to &#x000bd; recovery: 56 sec in <italic toggle="yes">fat2</italic><sup><italic toggle="yes">N103-2</italic></sup>, 92 sec in control; <xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B</xref>,<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">E</xref>; Movie 1), but the trend differed during later recovery, complicating interpretation of this data. We note that Sema5c-3xGFP levels at interfaces were lower than those of Lar-3xGFP normally (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4H</xref>,<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">I</xref>), and were even lower in <italic toggle="yes">fat2</italic><sup><italic toggle="yes">N103-2</italic></sup> epithelia, which may have impaired our ability to resolve changes in recovery speed. Altogether, these data show that Fat2 has a stabilizing effect on Lar and perhaps on Sema5c, and suggest that Fat2 concentrates them at leading edges by slowing their turnover rather than by speeding their arrival.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Lar and Sema5c promote collective migration in parallel downstream of Fat2</title><p id="P15">Fat2, Lar, and Sema5c are all required for normal collective migration, but whereas loss of Fat2 prevents migration entirely, loss of Lar only slows migration, and loss of Sema5c both slows it and delays its onset<sup><xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup> (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A</xref>,<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">B</xref>). These milder migration phenotypes suggest that Lar and Sema5c may act in parallel downstream of Fat2 to regulate cell motility. If true, analysis of the cell-scale phenotypes caused by loss of Lar or Sema5c could help us understand the two &#x0201c;arms&#x0201d; of the interface signaling system that Fat2 assembles. Fat2 promotes epithelial migration both by increasing cell protrusivity and by polarizing cells&#x02019; protrusions in the direction of tissue movement<sup><xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup>, so we asked if Lar or Sema5c play similar roles in protrusion formation and polarity. These roles have previously been studied using F-actin labeling<sup><xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup>, but we recently found that this approach misses much of the protrusive activity in <italic toggle="yes">fat2</italic><sup><italic toggle="yes">N103-2</italic></sup> epithelia<sup><xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup>. We therefore used live imaging and membrane labeling to re-examine the protrusion phenotypes caused by loss of Lar or Sema5c alone, and to build on this by determining the effect of losing both proteins together.</p><p id="P16">First, we examined Lar&#x02019;s role in protrusion formation and polarity. F-actin staining had suggested that cells lacking Lar are less protrusive than normal<sup><xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup>. However, using membrane labeling, we detected no reduction in protrusivity in <italic toggle="yes">lar</italic><sup><italic toggle="yes">13.2/bola1</italic></sup> epithelia (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5C</xref>,<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">D</xref>; Movie 3). This suggests that Lar increases F-actin enrichment within protrusions, but is not required for protrusion formation. Loss of Lar did, however, disrupt protrusion polarity. Whereas control epithelia had most protrusions pointed in the direction of migration, epithelia lacking Lar had a sizeable minority pointed rearwards, and their protrusions were less aligned with migration overall (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Figs. 5C</xref>,<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">E</xref>; <xref rid="SD4" ref-type="supplementary-material">S4</xref>; Movie 3). These data show that Lar helps polarize protrusions across the tissue, and suggest that Fat2&#x02019;s role in this process is due in part to its ability to localize Lar.</p><p id="P17">We then performed the same analysis for Sema5c. <italic toggle="yes">Sema5c</italic><sup><italic toggle="yes">K175</italic></sup> epithelia initiate migration later in development than normal, and their migration is slow and difficult to preserve ex vivo<sup><xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup>. Consistently, about &#x000bd; of the <italic toggle="yes">Sema5c</italic><sup><italic toggle="yes">K175</italic></sup> epithelia were migrating detectably, albeit slowly, and several others had a degree of protrusion polarity that likely indicated they had been migrating prior to dissection <xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Figs. 5A</xref>,<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">B</xref>; <xref rid="SD4" ref-type="supplementary-material">S4B</xref>). In agreement with previous findings based on F-actin staining<sup><xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup>, we did not observe a difference in the membrane protrusivity of <italic toggle="yes">Sema5c</italic><sup><italic toggle="yes">K175</italic></sup> epithelia. In the detectably-migrating subset of epithelia, protrusion polarity also appeared normal (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Figs. 5C</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">E</xref>; <xref rid="SD4" ref-type="supplementary-material">S4</xref>; Movie 3). The slow migration speeds of these epithelia therefore do not seem to be caused by protrusion defects, although it is possible that Sema5c regulates protrusions in ways we did not detect. Alternatively, Sema5c may primarily regulate other aspects of cell motility such as contractility or adhesion.</p><p id="P18">Finally, we asked whether Lar and Sema5c work in parallel to promote collective migration by expressing <italic toggle="yes">lar</italic>-RNAi in follicle cells of <italic toggle="yes">Sema5c</italic><sup><italic toggle="yes">K175</italic></sup> egg chambers. These epithelia failed to migrate and had unpolarized protrusions in all cases, making them indistinguishable from <italic toggle="yes">fat2</italic><sup><italic toggle="yes">N103-2</italic></sup> epithelia (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Figs. 5A</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">C</xref>,<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">E</xref>; <xref rid="SD4" ref-type="supplementary-material">S4</xref>; Movie 3). We conclude that Lar and Sema5c act in parallel to regulate cell motility, likely through distinct effectors. These data further suggest that Fat2&#x02019;s polarization of both Lar and Sema5c to leading edges is a major means by which it regulates the collective migration of follicle cells.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S7"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P19">The follicle cells use biochemical signaling across their leading-trailing interfaces to polarize their migration machinery at interface, cell, and tissue scales.

Fat2 acts at the trailing edge of each cell to concentrate both Lar and Sema5c at the leading edge of the cell behind, and it appears to do so, at least in part, by slowing their turnover at this site. By contrast, Lar and Sema5c play at most minor roles in the localization of Fat2. In this way, Fat2 coordinates the activities of two effector proteins with distinct functions, allowing them to work synergistically to promote highly persistent collective migration.</p><p id="P20">One defining feature of this Fat2-based signaling system is that most of the component proteins colocalize in interface-spanning puncta. Cadherins often self-organize into clusters<sup><xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref></sup>, making it likely that this punctate organization stems from Fat2. However, whether Fat2 recruits Lar and Sema5c into the puncta through direct binding or through intermediary proteins is unknown. An ectopic Fat2 pool did not cause redistribution of Lar, suggesting that additional inputs are necessary for recruitment. We also do not know how Sema5c&#x02019;s receptor, PlexA, fits into this model. Like Fat2, PlexA is enriched at cells&#x02019; trailing edges and helps to localize Sema5c, and yet antibody staining indicates that PlexA only partially colocalizes with the Fat2-based puncta. The biggest open question is how Fat2 becomes localized to the trailing edge, as this appears to be the key event that polarizes the entire signaling system. Mechanical feedback from collective migration itself is required for Fat2&#x02019;s polarization to trailing edges<sup><xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup>, but the nature of this feedback, and whether Fat2 has a trans binding partner that further stabilizes its localization, will be important areas for future investigation.</p><p id="P21">This work also sheds light on how Lar and Sema5c work together to promote collective migration. Loss of either protein alone impairs migration but does not stop it<sup><xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup>. By contrast, removing both proteins together fully blocks migration in a way that is indistinguishable from loss of Fat2. These data suggest that once Fat2 concentrates Lar and Sema5c to cells&#x02019; leading edges, they then act in parallel to promote collective migration, likely by polarizing distinct aspects of the migration machinery.</p><p id="P22">What aspects of the migration machinery do Lar and Sema5c each control? In the case of Lar, it seems to be part of the bridge between Fat2 and WAVE complex-dependent protrusions&#x02014;both Fat2 and Lar increase protrusive F-actin enrichment at leading edges (Fat2 in trans and Lar in cis), and both also help polarize protrusions in the direction of migration. In addition, Lar acts in trans to promote retraction of the trailing edge of the cell ahead<sup><xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup>, but the mechanistic basis for this trans function, and the degree to which it is separable from Lar&#x02019;s cis function, remain undetermined. In the case of Sema5c, cell-scale loss-of-function phenotypes have proven more elusive, but enrichment of PlexA at trailing edges and the ability of overexpressed Sema5c to suppress protrusion in trans both point to the trailing edge as the likely site of regulation<sup><xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P23">By positioning both Lar and Sema5c, Fat2 integrates two features of interface signaling systems known to operate in other collectively migrating cell types but not yet seen together. The first feature is the use of a trailing edge-associated mechanical cue to orient protrusions in the cell behind<sup><xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>,<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref></sup>. Mechanical localization of Fat2 to trailing edges polarizes protrusions in the following cell, in part by localizing Lar<sup><xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup>. The second feature is the use of contact inhibition of locomotion<sup><xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref></sup>, which causes cells to polarize away from one another by suppressing protrusion and/or increasing contractility at the point of contact<sup><xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>,<xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref></sup>. By localizing Lar and Sema5c to leading edges, Fat2 positions them to enforce trailing edge behavior at the contacting edge of the cell ahead. Therefore, Fat2 translates a mechanical cue into bi-directional signaling across leading-trailing interfaces to coordinate cell migratory behaviors for collective migration.</p></sec><sec id="S8"><title>Methods and Materials</title><sec id="S9"><title>Materials, data, and code availability</title><p id="P24">Code used in data analysis, all numerical datasets, and plasmid maps are available at <ext-link xlink:href="https://github.com/a9w/epithelial_migration_signaling" ext-link-type="uri">https://github.com/a9w/epithelial_migration_signaling</ext-link>.

This region includes the cell-cell interface and any protrusions that extend across it from either of the neighboring cells.

These were encoded as 1080 p30 MP4 files with H.264 (x264) video encoder using HandBrake 1.4.</p></sec><sec id="S27"><title>Reproducibility and statistical analysis</title><p id="P44">Two or more biological replicates were performed for each experiment, with each containing egg chambers pooled from multiple flies, and results confirmed to be qualitatively consistent between them. Visibly damaged egg chambers were excluded from all analyses. No randomization of treatment groups was performed, and experiments were not performed with blinding. Sample sizes were not predetermined using a statistical method. The number of egg chambers, interfaces, and/or filopodia (n) analyzed for each experiment can be found in the associated figure or figure legend. Statistical tests performed and their significance can also be found in figures or figure legends. An alpha of 0.05 was used to determine significance in all cases, but we have also attempted to plot data distributions in ways that allow the reader to weigh their similarities and differences for themselves. Statistical testing was all conducted using GraphPad Prism 9. Based on visual inspection, all datasets appeared normally distributed, and statistical tests assuming normalcy were used throughout. All t-tests were two-tailed. A one-way ANOVA was used when more than two conditions were compared. A repeated measures one-way ANOVA was used for analysis of genetic mosaic epithelia, in which multiple genetic conditions were present in the same tissue. Welch&#x02019;s corrections were performed and Dunnet&#x02019;s T3 multiple comparison tests used for datasets in which the variance did not appear consistent between conditions (indicated in figure legends). Otherwise, post-hoc Tukey&#x02019;s multiple comparison tests were used. Initial and post-hoc multiple comparisons testing was conducted on all data present in the corresponding plots with two exceptions: in <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C</xref>, only data including the same fluorophore were compared, and in <xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5B</xref>, data from conditions with gray and white background shading were collected and analyzed separately.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM1"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material id="SD1" position="float" content-type="local-data"><label>Supplement 1</label><media xlink:href="media-1.mp4" id="d64e964" position="anchor" mimetype="video" mime-subtype="mp4"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="SD2" position="float" content-type="local-data"><label>Supplement 2</label><media xlink:href="media-2.mp4" id="d64e967" position="anchor" mimetype="video" mime-subtype="mp4"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="SD3" position="float" content-type="local-data"><label>Supplement 3</label><media xlink:href="media-3.mp4" id="d64e970" position="anchor" mimetype="video" mime-subtype="mp4"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="SD4" position="float" content-type="local-data"><label>Supplement 4</label><media xlink:href="NIHPP2023.02.28.530349v1-supplement-4.pdf" id="d64e973" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="S28"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p id="P45">This study was supported by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) under grants R01 GM126047 and R35 GM148485 to S.H.B. and T32 HD055164 to A.M.W..
