Previous work has demonstrated that chondrocytes from older cadaveric donors have elevated levels of DNA damage as compared to chondrocytes from younger donors. The purpose of this study was to determine whether a decline in DNA repair efficiency is one explanation for the accumulation of DNA damage with age, and to quantify the improvement in repair with activation of Sirtuin 6 (SIRT6). Using an acute irradiation model to bring the baseline level of all donors to the same starting point, this study demonstrates a decline in repair efficiency during aging when comparing chondrocytes from young (&#x02264;45 years old), middle-aged (50&#x02013;65 years old), or older (&#x0003e;70 years old) cadaveric donors with no known history of OA or macroscopic cartilage degradation at isolation. Activation of SIRT6 in middle-aged chondrocytes with MDL-800 (20 &#x003bc;M) improved the repair efficiency, while inhibition with EX-527 (10 &#x003bc;M) inhibited the rate of repair and the increased the percentage of cells that retained high levels of damage. Treating chondrocytes from older donors with MDL-800 for 48 hours significantly reduced the amount of DNA damage, despite this damage having accumulated over decades. Lastly, chondrocytes isolated from the proximal femurs of mice between 4 months and 22 months of age revealed both an increase in DNA damage with aging, and a decrease in DNA damage following MDL-800 treatment.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>DNA Damage</kwd><kwd>Sirtuins</kwd><kwd>MDL-800</kwd><kwd>DNA Repair</kwd><kwd>Cartilage</kwd><kwd>Osteoarthritis</kwd><kwd>Aging</kwd><kwd>Comet assay</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1"><title>Introduction:</title><p id="P4">Osteoarthritis (OA) is a chronic joint disease affecting approximately 13% of the US adult population and is characterized by the degradation of articular cartilage, synovial inflammation, and subchondral bone remodeling<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup>.

This irradiation model allowed us to apply nearly instantaneous damage to the cells and conduct a precise time-course study of repair by transferring the slides directly to the lysis buffer (experimental approach in <xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>). Importantly, chondrocytes from distinct age ranges of young (&#x02264;45 years old), middle (50&#x02013;65 years old), and older (&#x0003e;70 years old) had a similar amount of DNA damage immediately after irradiation, indicating that this bolus of damage was sufficient to overcome the background differences in accumulated damage. The ability of the chondrocytes to resolve DNA damage from this equal starting point over the course of 4 hours was impaired in the middle-aged and older donors as compared to the young donors (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>). The older donors had a significantly higher percentage of DNA in comet tails as compared to the middle and/or younger donors at 60, 120, and 240 minutes (p&#x0003c;0.05, multiple comparisons test). By 4 hours post-irradiation, most of the damage was resolved in chondrocytes from younger donors, whereas the average percentage of DNA in comet tails remained elevated for both middle-aged and older donors. Additional insight can be gained by assessing the distribution of damage within individual cells for each donor, as shown for representative young, middle, and older donors (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>). Of note, there was a bifurcated response in the older donors, with a significant fraction of cells retaining very high levels of damage (dotted line at 60% of damage in comet tails). When quantified across all donors, 27.6% of chondrocytes in the older group retained this high level of damage at 4 hours, whereas this percentage was 12.5% and 2.6% for middle and younger donors, respectively (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref>). Analysis of chondrocytes with &#x0003c;15% DNA in comet tails at 4 hours showed that 68.7%, 49.6%, and 41.3% of cells from young, middle, and older donors, respectively, repaired the damage from irradiation to near-baseline levels (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>SIRT6 activation and inhibition affects the repair efficiency of chondrocytes.</title><p id="P10">As SIRT6 is critical in the DNA repair process of cells, we sought to study how modulating SIRT6 activity impacts the repair of DNA. Using the same irradiation and comet assay system to study repair efficiency, chondrocytes from middle-aged donors were pre-treated for 2 hours with MDL-800 (activator), EX-527 (inhibitor), or DMSO (vehicle control). Following irradiation, the slides were placed back into media baths with their respective treatments for recovery (15 to 240 minutes post-irradiation), such that the cells were receiving SIRT6 activation/inhibition for the entirety of the study (experimental approach in <xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>). When assessed by repeated measures two-way ANOVA without consideration of EX-527 treatment, MDL-800 treated groups showed lower DNA damage as compared to DMSO in middle-aged donors (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>, main effects p-value = 0.005). Similarly, when DMSO and MDL-800 were compared in chondrocytes from older donors (&#x0003e;70 years), there was reduced damage with MDL-800 treatment at 30, 60, 120, and 240 minutes (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6A</xref>). Further, MDL-800 reduced the percentage of cells with high damage (&#x0003e;60% DNA in comet tails) at 4 hours from 20.1% to 4.9% (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6B</xref>). When EX-527 was also considered in the ANOVA for middle-aged donors, this inhibitor showed strong effects with significantly more DNA damage as compared to the DMSO and/or MDL-800 groups at baseline, 60, 120, and 240 minutes of repair (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>).

The first two findings made use of irradiation to initiate a bolus of damage. This system was particularly valuable in that the level of damage immediately following irradiation was consistent across all ages and treatment groups, allowing us to directly compare the progressive reduction in DNA damage over time.</p><p id="P14">There is growing evidence that the efficiency of DNA damage repair declines with age (reviewed in <sup><xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup> and <sup><xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></sup>). Previous work has largely been performed in fibroblasts and lymphocytes, but the current study confirms that aging also affects the repair of DNA damage in primary human chondrocytes. We used the alkaline comet assay to provide a sensitive and quantitative measure of DNA damage levels. Upon placement in a lysis solution, single strand breaks (SSBs), double strand breaks (DSBs), and other forms of damage (i.e., abasic sites) relax the supercoiled DNA loops of the nucleus, enabling easier movement of the DNA through the agarose gel when an electric field is applied<sup><xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup>. As a result, damaged DNA produces a &#x0201c;comet tail&#x0201d; while intact DNA remains in the &#x0201c;comet head&#x0201d;. One advantage of this assay is the single-cell nature of the readout. This allowed us to observe that chondrocytes from older donors had a larger percentage of cells that showed very little repair and instead retained a high damage burden at four hours post-irradiation. This finding aligns with a previous study in lymphocytes that showed the primary difference with age in response to irradiation was the increased subset of cells that retained high damage<sup><xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P15">SIRT6 is involved in numerous biological processes with relevance to aging<sup><xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref></sup>, including a role in multiple DNA damage repair pathways<sup><xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref></sup>.

For human chondrocytes, 48 hours of treatment with MDL-800 lowered the percentage of DNA in comet tails from 21.3% to 11.3%.

Our previous work also supports a causal role for DNA damage in chondrocyte senescence, as the application of 10 Gy irradiation (which recapitulates the level of DNA damage in older donors<sup><xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup>) is capable of inducing senescence in cartilage explants when paired with a mitogenic stimulus<sup><xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref></sup>.

Next, the slides were placed into an electrophoresis chamber and an electric field of 1 V/cm for 20 minutes was applied. Slides were washed with dH<sub>2</sub>O and stained with NucBlue<sup>&#x02122;</sup> (R37605; Thermo Fisher Scientific). Fluorescence images were captured with an EVOS M5000 microscope (AMF5000; Thermo Fisher Scientific). Image analysis and comet quantification were performed for approximately 100 cells per condition using the OpenComet plugin software in ImageJ.</p></sec><sec id="S13"><title>Statistical Analysis</title><p id="P22">Comet data were analyzed and plotted using GraphPad Prism 9. Statistical analysis was performed using paired t-test, two-way ANOVA, or two-way repeated measures ANOVA. Multiple comparison test used either Sidak&#x02019;s (two treatment groups) or Tukey&#x02019;s (three treatment groups) within each time point.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="S14"><title>Acknowledgements:</title><p id="P23">We appreciate the work of Dr. Richard Loeser&#x02019;s laboratory members for help in isolating human cartilage.
