Here we present Rolosense, a virus sensing platform that transduces the motion of synthetic DNA-based motors transporting 5-micron particles on RNA fuel chips. Motors and chips are modified with virus-binding aptamers that lead to stalling of motion. Therefore, motors perform a &#x0201c;mechanical test&#x0201d; of viral target and stall in the presence of whole virions which represents a unique mechanism of transduction distinct from conventional assays. Rolosense can detect SARS-CoV-2 spiked in artificial saliva and exhaled breath condensate with a sensitivity of 10<sup>3</sup> copies/mL and discriminates among other respiratory viruses. The assay is modular and amenable to multiplexing, as we demonstrated one-pot detection of influenza A and SARS-CoV-2. As a proof-of-concept, we show readout can be achieved using a smartphone camera in as little as 15 mins without any sample preparation steps. Taken together, mechanical detection using Rolosense can be broadly applied to any viral target and has the potential to enable rapid, low-cost, point-of-care screening of circulating viruses.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p id="P4">Virus sensing is primarily performed using nucleic acid-based assays or alternatively by detecting protein antigens using colorimetric, fluorogenic, or electrochemical reporters. The gold-standard diagnostic for SARS-CoV-2 infection is RT-qPCR which detects down to ~10<sup>2-3</sup> viral RNA copies/mL and is typically performed at central facilities with a 10&#x02013;15-hour turnaround time.<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> Alternate nucleic acid-based diagnostics include isothermal amplification such as loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP),<sup><xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA),<sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> and the integration of CRISPR-Cas systems<sup><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> which don&#x02019;t require special instrumentation but can suffer from nonspecific amplification under isothermal conditions leading to false-positive results. On the other hand, protein antigen tests which work by capturing viral proteins on immobilized antibodies, such as the lateral flow assay (LFA), are less sensitive but fairly simple to use and result in a fast turnaround time.<sup><xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> Nonetheless, this has led to their wide adoption as LFA tests can be performed at home without the need for bulky temperature-control or spectrophotometer instruments. Developing new platforms that combine the sensitivity of RT-qPCR with the simplicity and fast turnaround time of LFAs is needed to address current and future pandemics.</p><p id="P5">One unexplored approach for chemical sensing pertains to mechanical testing of an analyte. For example, single molecule force spectroscopy methods, such as optical tweezers<sup><xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> and atomic force spectroscopy (AFM) <sup><xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> can identify single virus-ligand interactions with high fidelity. Thus, mechanical testing of a virus offers an alternate strategy for detection with exquisite sensitivity. Unfortunately, using force spectroscopy for analytical sensing is prohibitive because of the serial nature of these methods - interrogating one molecule at a time - and the need for expensive and dedicated instrumentation. Autonomous, force-generating motors that can be characterized in parallel may offer an alternate approach to using mechanotransduction for analytical sensing.</p><p id="P6">Herein, we present a mechanical-based viral sensing platform termed Rolosense to detect whole intact SARS-CoV-2 particles. Rolosense is a label-free and amplification-free approach which is advantageous, as such methods reduce cost and, in our case, simplify instrumentation needed for readout avoiding fluorescence dyes and spectrometers that are commonly used for nucleic acid-based assays. Our assay leverages DNA-based motors that function as the mechanical transducer reporting on specific target binding events (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a</xref>). We leveraged our recent work using these motors to detect and transduce DNA logic operations.<sup><xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup> The motor consists of a DNA-coated spherical particle (5 &#x003bc;m diameter) that hybridizes to a surface modified with complementary RNA. The particle moves with speeds of &#x0003e;1 &#x003bc;m/min upon addition of ribonuclease H (RNaseH), which selectively hydrolyzes duplexed RNA and ignores single stranded RNA. The DNA motor consumes chemical energy on the RNA chip to generate piconewton mechanical work. To detect the SARS-CoV-2 virus, the DNA motors and the RNA chip are modified with virus binding ligands (i.e., aptamers) with high affinity for the S1 subunit of spike protein that is abundantly displayed on each virion.<sup><xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup> Virus binding to both the motor and surface leads to motor stalling. In other words, the microparticle moves along the surface through a &#x0201c;cog-and-wheel&#x0201d; mechanism and only specific the SARS-CoV-2 viral target acts as a &#x0201c;wrench&#x0201d; to inhibit this activity. Unlike conventional nucleic acid and protein assays that have received EUA, we do not need fluorescence nor absorbance measurements to detect a target of interest. Instead, detection of the viral target occurs when the <italic toggle="yes">mechanical force</italic> generated by the motor (~100 pN) is insufficient to overcome the mechanical stability of the aptamer-target complex.<sup><xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup> This binding event is transduced in a label-free fashion by measuring the displacement of the motor. Another key advantage of our assay is the ability to multiplex and detect multiple respiratory viruses in the same assay. This will be critical in-patient care and in minimizing false positive results due to similar symptoms.</p><p id="P7">Using motors modified with multivalent aptamers that have high affinity for spike protein, we were able to demonstrate a limit of detection (LoD) of 10<sup>3</sup> viral copies/mL of SARS-CoV-2 WA-1, B.1.617.2, and BA.1 in artificial saliva and in exhaled breath condensate without any sample preparation or amplification steps. Note that these were the variants available to us over the course of this study. We demonstrate specific detection of SARS-CoV-2 viral particles as our motors do not respond to influenza A or other human corona viruses such as OC43 and 229E. We also show the ability to multiplex by detecting influenza A and SARS-CoV-2 in the same &#x0201c;pot.&#x0201d; Our assay can be readout <italic toggle="yes">via</italic> smartphone in as little as 15 mins. Overall, Rolosense enables rapid, sensitive, and multiplexed viral detection for disease monitoring.</p><sec id="S1"><title>Design principles of Rolosense platform</title><p id="P8">We first functionalized DNA-based motors and chips with DNA aptamers reported in literature that had high affinity for spike protein (S1) (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table 1</xref> and <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 1</xref>).<sup><xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup> Aptamers as virus binding ligands have several advantages such as ease of storage, long-term stability, and a smaller molecular weight. We started our investigations with a 50 nt S1 aptamer, aptamer 1. As depicted in <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1b</xref>, the amine modified motors were functionalized and coated with a binary mixture of both the DNA leg and aptamer 1. The planar Rolosense chip was modified with a binary mixture of Cy3-labeled RNA fuel and aptamer 1. The oligonucleotides were tethered to the surface by hybridization to a monolayer of 15mer ssDNA, which we call the DNA anchor. Tuning the ratio of the DNA legs/RNA fuel to the aptamer was critical as there is a tradeoff between multivalent avidity to the virion and efficient motor motion.<sup><xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup> For example, high densities of aptamer lead to efficient virus binding but hamper processive motion. Conversely, low aptamer densities diminish virus binding, but enhance motor speed and processivity. Accordingly, we screened different ratios of aptamer/DNA leg on the particle and aptamer/RNA fuel on the chip and measured motor net displacement over a 30 min time window. We found that the introduction of aptamer at 10% density or greater on the particle or the planar surface led to a significant reduction in motor displacements (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 2</xref>). Also, motor distance was more sensitive to aptamer density on the spherical particle compared to that of the planar surface. Our results suggested that an optimal aptamer density was 10% for the particle and 50% for the planar surface, as these motors showed 1.95 +/&#x02212; 0.97 &#x003bc;m net displacement over a 30 min time window compared to the no aptamer control in which the motors traveled 2.56 +/&#x02212; 1.17 &#x003bc;m in 30 mins (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 2</xref>). Based on these results, all subsequent experiments were conducted using motors, and chips modified with 10%, and 50% aptamer density, respectively.</p><p id="P9">We first tested our assay using GFP-tagged virus-like particles (VLPs) expressing the trimeric spike protein. We used non-infectious SARS-CoV-2 S D614G HIV-1 virus-like particles (spike VLPs) (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 3</xref>). As a control to test for cross reactivity, we used GFP-tagged HIV-1 particles that lacked spike protein (bald VLPs). The motor surface was functionalized with 10% aptamer 1 and chip surface with 50% aptamer 1.<sup><xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup> The VLPs were incubated with the aptamer functionalized DNA-based motors in 1xPBS (phosphate-buffered saline) for 30 mins at room temperature. After 30 mins, the DNA-based motors were washed via centrifugation (15,000 rpm, 1 min) and then added to the Rolosense chip that was also coated with the same aptamer. In the presence of RNaseH the DNA-based motors incubated with the spike VLPs remained stalled on the surface (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1c</xref>). The VLPs were likely sandwiched between the DNA-based motor and the chip surface, and this binding led to a stalling force that halted motion. In contrast, DNA-based motors incubated with the bald VLPs lacking the spike protein translocated on the surface which is expected because the bald VLPs do not bind to the aptamers. This was confirmed by optical and fluorescence microscopy (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1d</xref>). Motors incubated with the bald VLPs displayed micron-length depletion tracks in the Cy3-RNA monolayer. The lack of fluorescence signal in the GFP channel indicates that there was minimal binding of bald VLPs to the motors. On the contrary, motors incubated with spike VLPs did not display Cy3-RNA depletion tracks and the GFP fluorescence channel showed puncta colocalized with the stalled motors confirming that the stalling was due to spike VLPs binding. Brightfield real-time particle tracking also validated this conclusion. We observed long trajectories and net displacements greater than 1.5 &#x003bc;m for motors incubated with bald VLPs. The spike VLP incubated motors, on the other hand, displayed short trajectories and sub 1 &#x003bc;m net displacements (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1e</xref> and <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">f</xref>). Control motors without VLPs showed greater displacements than that of the bald VLP samples (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 4</xref>), likely due to non-specific bald VLPs binding. Regardless, these results demonstrate that the Rolosense design and mechanism for viral detection is valid and further motivated our subsequent experiments.</p><p id="P10">In principle, Rolosense is not unique to aptamers and virtually any virus binding ligand could be used for viral sensing. That said, in preliminary screens with two commercial antibodies, we found motor stalling with bald VLPs suggesting issues with specificity (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 5</xref>). We thus focused efforts on screening across different aptamers reported to display high affinity and specificity for SARS-CoV-2 S1. Specifically, aptamers 1, 2, and 3 <sup><xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup> have reported K<sub>D</sub> values in the low nanomolar range for S1. Using motors and surfaces functionalized with each of these aptamers (10% motor, and 50% chip), we showed that aptamer 3 was the most sensitive and specific for Rolosense (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1g</xref>). Based on this data, we performed all subsequent experiment using aptamer 3, unless noted otherwise.</p></sec><sec id="S2"><title>Detecting SARS-CoV-2 in artificial saliva</title><p id="P11">We then aimed to validate our Rolosense assay using authentic SARS-CoV-2 virus that was UV-inactivated. We tested the original SARS-CoV-2 strains first isolated in the US in the state of Washington, and hence described here as the Washington (WA-1) strain. For these sets of experiments, we spiked the virus into artificial saliva and performed Rolosense for viral readout. First, we wanted to test whether the motors and the Rolosense assay could tolerate the artificial saliva matrix since it contains mucins and divalent ions such as calcium that may interfere with the assay. Motors were suspended in artificial saliva for 30 min and then added to the aptamer-decorated chip for readout. We found that motion was not affected by the artificial saliva matrix and the motors displayed long trajectories with the addition of RNaseH enzyme and net displacement (2.20 &#x003bc;m +/&#x02212; 1.38 &#x003bc;m) was comparable to controls performed in 1xPBS (2.97 &#x003bc;m +/&#x02212; 1.40 &#x003bc;m) (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 6</xref>). Once we validated the assay in artificial saliva, we next incubated motors functionalized with 10% of aptamer 3 with 10<sup>8</sup> copies/mL of SARS-CoV-2 WA-1 for 30 mins at room temperature. After 30 mins, the DNA-based motors were washed via centrifugation (15,000 rpm, 1 min) and then added to the Rolosense chip presenting aptamer 3. In the presence of RNaseH the motors remained stalled on the surface and did not display depletion tracks (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2a</xref>). Control motors without virus displayed long depletion tracks in the Cy3-RNA channel. Brightfield particle tracking confirmed these results as we observed hampered particle trajectories for SARS-CoV-2 WA-1 condition compared to the long trajectories displayed by motors without any virus (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2b</xref>). In a control experiment in which we withheld the surface aptamer, we observed that aptamer presenting motors incubated with 10<sup>7</sup> copies/mL of SARS-CoV-2 WA-1 displayed long net displacements and depletion tracks in the Cy3-RNA channel (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 7</xref>). This confirmed that the stalling observed in the presence of virus is due to virus particles bridging the aptamers on the bead to the aptamers on the chip. To optimize workflow of the Rolosense assay, we tested whether we could forego the washing step following motor incubation with virus. Our results indicated that running the assay without the wash step does not degrade the integrity of the chip as the RNA on the surface remained intact (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 8</xref>). We also observed similar net displacements between the motors with and without wash when incubated with 10<sup>7</sup> copies/mL of WA-1 virus. In addition, we tested whether decreasing the virus sample incubation time affects the performance of Rolosense. We show that decreasing the incubation time with the motors down to 10 minutes does not impact the performance of the Rolosense assay as the majority of the motors remained stalled (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 9</xref>).</p><p id="P12">Next, we aimed to determine the limit of detection (LoD) of the Rolosense assay in artificial saliva. In triplicate experiments we demonstrated a LoD of ~10<sup>4</sup> copies/mL for the Washington strain (WA-1) (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2c</xref>, <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 10</xref>). We also tested the Rolosense assay with other SARS-CoV-2 variants such as Delta (B.1.617.2) and Omicron (BA.1) spiked in artificial saliva. The Rolosense assay showed a sensitive response to both B.1.617.2 and BA.1 with an LoD of ~10<sup>3</sup>-10<sup>4</sup> copies/mL. The LoD for the B.1.617.2 and WA-1 was greater than that for the BA.1 variant which was expected given that aptamer 3 was selected using S1 of the initial Wuhan strain. Interestingly, the mutations in S1 for the B.1.617.2 strain primarily led to an increase in the net positive charge of the protein<sup><xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup> which likely aids in enhancing binding to a negatively charged aptamer. The LoD for the BA.1 strain is weaker, but this is expected given the increased number of mutations in this most recent variant. Importantly, Rolosense demonstrates an LoD that is akin to that of typical LFAs but using a DNA motor.<sup><xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup></p><p id="P13">To test for cross-reactivity and specificity of our assay, we measured the response of the motors incubated with other respiratory viruses such as the seasonal common cold viruses, HCoV OC43 and 229E, as well as the influenza A virus. These respiratory viruses present similar symptoms as the SARS-CoV-2 virus and thus it is important to distinguish between them. These samples were prepared in a similar manner to that of the SARS-CoV-2 variants and spiked in artificial saliva to run the Rolosense assay. As depicted in <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3a</xref>, the motors displayed high specificity and responded with motion to HCoV OC43, HCoV 229E, and Influenza A which is in direct contrast to the stalling observed in the presence of SARS-CoV-2 viruses (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3b</xref>, <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 11</xref>). This data, along with the LoD data, confirm that the Rolosense assay exhibits a sensitive and specific response to the SARS-CoV-2 virus which is ultimately the result of the sensitivity and specificity of aptamer 3 to its SARS-CoV-2 target.</p></sec><sec id="S3"><title>Multiplexed detection of SARS-CoV-2 and Influenza A viruses</title><p id="P14">Given the need for distinguishing between a variety of respiratory viruses, we next aimed to test whether Rolosense can detect other viruses such as the influenza A virus. This is well suited for Rolosense, as the assay is modular and can easily be programmed to detect other whole virions. We created an influenza A motor by modifying it with 10% of influenza A aptamer reported in the literature, with the chip presenting 50% aptamer.<sup><xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup> Following the protocol for SARS-CoV-2, the motors were incubated with different concentrations of influenza A virus spiked in 1xPBS for 30 min. Although the motors stalled in the presence of high concentrations of influenza A virus such as 10<sup>10</sup> copies/mL, the assay performed poorly in detecting low copy numbers (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 12</xref>). To address this issue, we supplemented the 1xPBS solution with 1.5mM Mg<sup>+2</sup> since divalent cations aid in secondary structure formation of aptamers.<sup><xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup> As expected, the assay improved with the addition of Mg<sup>+2</sup> and we were able to detect as low as 10<sup>4</sup> copies/mL of influenza A virus using this aptamer. This suggests potential for Rolosense to detect influenza A infections, as a typical swab of patients with influenza yield ~10<sup>8</sup> genome copies/ml as estimated by PCR.<sup><xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup> After validating that Rolosense is modular and can be programmed to detect other viruses, we wanted to show multiplexed detection of SARS-CoV-2 and influenza A in the &#x0201c;same pot.&#x0201d; To achieve this, we used two different motors: 5 &#x003bc;m silica bead functionalized with influenza A aptamer and 6 &#x003bc;m polystyrene bead functionalized with aptamer 3. Here we are using the size refractive index of different particles to optically encode each motor in a label free manner using brightfield contrast.<sup><xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup> The chip was functionalized with 25% influenza A aptamer and 25% aptamer 3. As depicted in <xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4a</xref> when the influenza A motors (5&#x003bc;m silica) and SARS-CoV-2 motors (6&#x003bc;m polystyrene) were not incubated with virus, they responded with motion in the presence of RNaseH. We observed long depletion tracks in the Cy3 channel for both motors and analysis from brightfield particle tracking of over 300 motors resulted in net displacements of 2.88 &#x003bc;m +/&#x02212; 2.00 &#x003bc;m and 2.68 &#x003bc;m +/&#x02212; 1.83 &#x003bc;m for the influenza A and SARS-CoV-2 motors, respectively (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4b</xref>, <xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">c</xref>, <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary movie 1</xref>). In the same tube, both motors were then incubated with 10<sup>10</sup> copies/mL of the influenza A virus (in 1xPBS with 1.5mM Mg<sup>+2</sup>) for 30 mins at room temp. As a result, the influenza A motors remained stalled on the chip while the SARS-CoV-2 motors were free to move in the presence of RNaseH. We did not observe depletion tracks in the Cy3 channel for the influenza A motor, but the SARS-CoV-2 motors formed long depletion tracks. Brightfield particle tracking confirmed this result as the net displacement of the influenza A virus decreases, compared to no virus, and the SARS-CoV-2 motors exhibited an average net displacement of 2.60 +/&#x02212; 2.23 &#x003bc;m (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4c</xref>, <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary movie 2</xref>). The motors were also incubated with 10<sup>7</sup> copies/mL of SARS-CoV-2 WA-1 in 1xPBS with 1.5 mM Mg<sup>+2</sup>. In this condition, no tracks were observed for the SARS-CoV-2 motor but the influenza A motors formed long tracks (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4b</xref>).

As a proof-of-concept we used a smartphone (iPhone 13) to detect the motion of Rolosense motors exposed to artificial saliva spiked with SARS-CoV-2. We used a simple smartphone microscope set up (Cellscope) as shown in <xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5a</xref> which includes an LED light source and 10x magnification lens. For these experiments, we functionalized DNA motors and chip with aptamer 3. SARS-CoV-2 WA-1 and B.1.617.2 stocks were serially diluted in artificial saliva. The DNA motors were added to these known concentrations of virus and the samples were incubated 30 mins at room temperature. Following incubation in artificial saliva, the samples were added to the Rolosense chip and imaged for motion <italic toggle="yes">via</italic> smartphone. The smartphone analyzed timelapse imaging data matched that of high-end microscopy analysis, and we found that in 15 mins timelapse videos we could detect the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in artificial saliva with an LoD of ~10<sup>3</sup> copies/mL (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5b</xref>, <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary movies 5</xref> and <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">6</xref>).

Exhaled breath is cooled and condensed into a liquid phase and consists of water soluble volatiles as well as non-volatile compounds.<sup><xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></sup> Breath condensate has already been used as a sampling media for breath analysis for detection of analytes such as viruses, bacteria, proteins, and fatty acids.<sup><xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref></sup> We first collected breath condensate and mixed it with our motors without any virus to test whether Rolosense can tolerate breath condensate as the medium (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>). Our results indicate that breath condensate did not affect the robustness of our assay as motors without virus displayed comparable net displacements to motors diluted in 1xPBS (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 13a</xref>, <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">b</xref>). Moreover, we also found that breath condensate displayed little DNase and RNase activity, as indicated by the high fluorescence signal of the RNA monolayer, which is well suited for Rolosense.</p><p id="P17">To determine the LoD of SARS-CoV-2 sensing in breath condensate, we prepared samples in a similar manner as in artificial saliva. We first functionalized the DNA-based motors and chip with aptamer 3. B.1.617.2 stocks were serially diluted in collected breath condensate. The DNA-based motors were incubated with the virus samples in breath condensate for 30 mins at room temperature. After incubation, the samples were added to the Rolosense chip and imaged. From brightfield particle tracking, we demonstrate an LoD of ~10<sup>3</sup> copies/mL for SARS-CoV-2 B.1.617.2 (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6b</xref>). Our results show that the LoD is not affected when using breath condensate as the virus sensing matrix. Over the course of this study, we became aware of a &#x0201c;universal&#x0201d; aptamer aimed at targeting the S1 subunit of the spike protein of the BA.1 variant with high affinity.<sup><xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref></sup> Therefore to increase sensitivity in detecting the SARS-CoV-2 BA.1 variant given that it is the most widely spread variant at the moment, we functionalized our motor and chip surfaces with this BA.1 specific aptamer. As shown in <xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>, our data suggests that with this new aptamer we can detect as low as 10<sup>3</sup> copies/mL of the BA.1 variant and possibly as low as 10<sup>2</sup> copies/mL. These LoDs are highly promising as recent studies indicate that at early stages of infection with SARS-CoV-2 the estimated breath emission rate is 10<sup>5</sup> virus particles/min, which suggests that 1 min of breath condensate collection will provide sufficient material for accurate SARS-CoV-2 detection.<sup><xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref></sup></p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="P18">We developed a mechanical-based detection method of SARS-CoV-2 viral particles that is label-free and does not require fluorescence readout or absorbance measurements. Because the motor detects the virus itself rather than the nucleic acid material, there is no need for enzymatic amplification and sample processing steps. One striking feature of Rolosense is that it represents a new concept in biosensor design in that it employs a &#x0201c;mechanical transduction&#x0201d; mechanism based on performing a mechanical test of the analyte and the outcome of this mechanical test is converting viral binding into motion output. The motors only stall if the mechanical stability of virus binding ligands, which in our case are aptamers, exceed the forces generated by the motor. The aptamer-spike protein rupture force is the fundamental parameter we are measuring rather than the Kd of the aptamer. An additional potential advantage to mechanical transduction is that it may reduce non-specific binding and detect transient interactions. While force spectroscopy has yet to be performed on aptamer-spike complexes, ACE2-spike complexes with similar affinity do show rupture forces of 57 pN when using 800 pN/s loading rates.<sup><xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref></sup> Our past work estimated that each motor generates ~ 100 pN of force,<sup><xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup> but likely in our case, this force is dampened because we have significantly lower density of DNA and RNA on the motor and chip, respectively. Indeed, our recent modeling<sup><xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref></sup> suggests that lowering the magnitude of force generated by the motor can lead to enhanced biosensor performance. These estimates suggest that a single virus particle presenting 20&#x02013;40 copies of trimeric spike protein<sup><xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref></sup> will lead to motor stalling. Interestingly, when we used GFP-tagged VLPs in Rolosense we found that a population of stalled motors colocalized with single VLPs (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 14</xref>). Taken together, this suggests that Rolosense motor can respond and report on single SARS-CoV-2 virions.</p><p id="P19">We demonstrated that in artificial saliva we can detect up to 10<sup>3</sup> copies/mL of SARS-CoV-2 WA-1, B.1.617.2, and the variant of concern BA.1. To validate the specificity of our Rolosense assay, we tested for cross-reactivity with other respiratory viruses such as the seasonal common cold viruses, HCoV OC43 and 229E, as well as influenza A. We did not observe a distinguishable effect on Rolosense response. A key advantage of Rolosense is the ability to multiplex and detect multiple respiratory viruses in the same assay. This capability is important for point-of-care diagnostics and in minimizing false positive results due to similar symptoms caused by other respiratory viruses. We show that by encoding different virus specific DNA motors through size and refractive index we can distinguish between SARS-CoV-2 and influenza A in one &#x0201c;pot.&#x0201d; With the aim of enabling the key steps for a point-of-care diagnostic, we demonstrated that the Rolosense motors and chip can be used to conveniently detect SARS-CoV-2 using a smartphone and a magnifying lens as the reader. The assay was performed using a rapid, ~15 min readout without any intervention. Our assay is also suitable for exhaled breath condensate testing as we demonstrated an LoD of 10<sup>3</sup> copies/mL of the B.1.617.2 and BA.1 variants.</p><p id="P20">Our reported LoD of 10<sup>3</sup> copies/mL is comparable to that of lateral flow assays like the BinaxNOW COVID-19 Ag Card (Abbott Diagnostics Scarborough, Inc.) which have an LoD of 10<sup>5</sup> copies/mL for the BA.1 variant.<sup><xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref></sup> Rolosense takes advantage of multivalent binding which may contribute to LoD that is better than that of monomeric assays like LFA. Another strength of Rolosense is that it is highly modular and any whole virion that displays many copies of a target can be detected using our assay with appropriate aptamers. Also, multiplexed detection of SARS-CoV-2 and influenza A can, in principle, be scaled up to include a panel of viral targets as we could create tens of uniquely encoded motors. Such PCR panels for multiplexed detection of respiratory viruses is currently available,<sup><xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref></sup> and hence multiplexed Rolosense would find clinical applications as our assay is rapid and can be conducted conveniently without the need for a dedicated PCR instrument.</p><p id="P21">There are two main limitations inherent to Rolosense. The first is the sensitivity to RNase and DNase contamination in the biological samples. We have documented this issue (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 15</xref>), and selective nuclease inhibitors that target RNase A, B, and C (but not RNaseH) showed excellent potential to minimize this issue. Note however, that all assays that employ DNA or RNA aptamers for biological sensing also suffer from nuclease sensitivity. Nonetheless, we were excited to see that breath condensate is relatively low in nuclease matrix and hence this is well-suited for the Rolosense assay and for detecting respiratory virions.</p><p id="P22">A second limitation is the need to employ virus binding ligands that target spike protein (or other surface displayed proteins). This is not a weakness in of itself, but rather this is a challenge when pursuing highly mutable targets such as SARS-CoV-2 and influenza that are under high evolutionary pressure to conceal their surface epitopes from immune recognition.<sup><xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref></sup> This leads to frequent mutations in the spike protein which in contrast to nucleocapsid proteins that are infrequently altered.<sup><xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref></sup> Our work with the &#x0201c;universal&#x0201d; spike protein aptamer shown in Figure 7 represents one solution to this problem but the specificity of universal aptamers is weaker and hence more likely to cross-react with similar spike-presenting coronaviruses. Further development and deployment of Rolosense shows potential towards a point-of-care system, which will greatly facilitate frequent, on-site molecular diagnostics.</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>Methods</title><sec id="S8"><title>Materials</title><p id="P23">All oligonucleotides were purchased from Integrated DNA Technologies (IDT), stored at 4 &#x000b0;C (&#x02212;20 &#x000b0;C for RNA), and used without purification.

Motor translocation was then initiated with 100 &#x003bc;L rolling buffer which consisted of 73 &#x003bc;L DI water (73%), 5 &#x003bc;L of 10x RNaseH reaction buffer (25 mM Tris pH 8.0, 8 mM NaCl, 37.5 mM KCl, 1.5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>), 10 &#x003bc;L of formamide (10%), 10 &#x003bc;L of 7.5% (g ml<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>) Triton X (0.75%), 1 &#x003bc;L of RNaseH in 1 &#x000d7; PBS (five units), and 1 &#x003bc;L of 1 mM DTT (10 &#x003bc;M). RNAseH enzyme stock was stored on ice for up to 2 hours. Particle tracking was achieved through BF imaging by recording a timelapse at five second intervals for 30 minutes via the Nikon Elements software. High-resolution epifluorescence images (&#x000d7;100) of fluorescence-depletion tracks as well as VLP fluorescence intensity were acquired to verify that particle motion resulted from processive RNA hydrolysis and confirm VLP binding. The resulting timelapse files and high-resolution epifluorescence images were then saved for further analysis.</p></sec><sec id="S21"><title>Image processing and particle tracking</title><p id="P36">Image processing and particle tracking was performed in Fiji (ImageJ) as well as python. Timelapse app <italic toggle="yes">Lapse It</italic> v. 5.02 was used to record timelapse videos (5 sec/frame) of DNA motors on smartphone. The bioformats toolbox in Fiji (ImageJ) enabled direct transfer of Nikon Elements image files (*.nd2) into the Fiji (ImageJ) environment where all image/video processing was performed. Particle tracking was performed using the 2D/3D particle tracker from the Mosaic plugin in Fiji (ImageJ)<sup><xref rid="R45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref></sup> in which we generated .csv files with particle trajectories that were used for further analysis. The algorithms for processing the data for motor trajectories, net displacements, and speeds were performed on python v. 3.7.4.

The presence of virus particles leads to motor stalling which reduces the net displacement or distance travelled by the motors. Readout can be performed using simple brightfield timelapse imaging of the motors. In principle, readout can be performed in as little as 15 min using a smartphone camera. <bold>b,</bold> Schematic of DNA motor and chip functionalization. The DNA motors were modified with a binary mixture of with DNA leg and aptamers that have high affinity for SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. The Rolosense chip is a gold film also comprised of two nucleic acids: the RNA/DNA chimera, which is referred to as the RNA fuel, and the same aptamer as the motor. <bold>c,</bold> Schematic of the detection of SARS-CoV-2 virus. In the presence of VLPs expressed with spike protein (spike VLPs), the motors stall on the Rolosense chip following the addition of the RNaseH enzyme as the stalling force (red arrow) is greater than the force generated by the motor (green arrow). When incubated with the bald VLPs, or VLPs lacking the spike protein, the motors respond with motion and roll on the chip in the presence of RNAseH. <bold>d,</bold> Brightfield and fluorescence imaging of DNA motors detecting GFP-labeled spike VLPs. The RNA fuel was tagged with Cy3, shown here in red. Motors were incubated with 25pM of GFP-labeled bald and spike VLPs diluted in 1xPBS. Samples with GFP-labeled spike VLPs show stalled motors and no Cy3 depletion tracks in contrast to samples GFP-labeled bald VLPs. Note that stalled motors often showed GFP signal colocalization. <bold>e,</bold> Plots showing the trajectory of motors with bald and spike VLPs.
