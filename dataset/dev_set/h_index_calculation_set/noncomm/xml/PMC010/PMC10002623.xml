This indicates the presence of cortical-to-brainstem pathways that directly control brainstem breathing centers, but the neural circuit mechanisms of top-down breathing control remain poorly understood. Here, we identify neurons in the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) that project to the pontine reticular nucleus caudalis (PnC) and function to slow breathing rates. Optogenetic activation of this corticopontine pathway (dACC&#x02192;PnC neurons) in mice slows breathing and alleviates behaviors associated with negative emotions without altering valence. Calcium responses of dACC&#x02192;PnC neurons are tightly correlated with changes in breathing patterns entrained by behaviors, such as drinking. Activity is also elevated when mice find relief from an anxiety-provoking environment and slow their breathing pattern. Further, GABAergic inhibitory neurons within the PnC that receive direct input from dACC neurons decrease breathing rate by projecting to pontomedullary breathing centers. They also send collateral projections to anxiety-related structures in the forebrain, thus comprising a neural network that modulates breathing and negative affect in parallel. These analyses greatly expand our understanding of top-down breathing control and reveal circuit-based mechanisms by which slow breathing and anxiety relief are regulated together.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p id="P3">Breathing is more than simply a respiratory response to maintain gas homeostasis. Breathing rhythms are entrained by various purposeful (swallowing, vocalization) and emotional (sighing, yawning, purring) behaviors that require orofacial and pharyngeal activity<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup>.

Given this knowledge, the primary motor cortex<sup><xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> and high-order cortical regions, including the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC)<sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> and the supplementary motor area<sup><xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup>, have been implicated in the central, non-respiratory control of breathing. However, circuit-level research on breathing control has primarily focused on the medullary respiratory groups and their roles in generating rhythmic patterns of breathing. Precise mechanisms for the cortical control of breathing, in particular how top-down breathing circuits affect brainstem networks, remain elusive<sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup>. In this study, we identify a prefrontal-to-pontomedullary breathing circuit that slows breathing and alleviates negative affect in parallel.</p><sec id="S1"><title>Identification of a top-down neuronal circuit that slows breathing</title><p id="P4">To identify circuits that could potentially relay top-down cortical inputs to breathing centers in the brainstem, we performed an extensive search of the Mouse Brain Connectivity Atlas (using a &#x02018;target search&#x02019; tool; Allen Brain Institute, <ext-link xlink:href="http://connectivity.brain-map.org" ext-link-type="uri">connectivity.brain-map.org</ext-link>) and the Mouse Brain Atlas (<ext-link xlink:href="http://mouse.brain-map.org" ext-link-type="uri">mouse.brain-map.org</ext-link>) in the Allen institute for Brain Sciences (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Extended data Fig. 1</xref>). We looked for regions that: 1) receive inputs from the prefrontal cortex, 2) project to pontomedullary breathing centers, and 3) are enriched for markers of inhibitory cell types (for inhibitory regulation of breathing). One of several regions that satisfies these three criteria (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Extended data Fig. 1a</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">d</xref>) was the pontine reticular nucleus caudalis (PnC). To identify prefrontal neurons that project to the PnC, we performed retrograde tracing using the cholerae-toxin B (CTB) tracer. CTB tracer conjugated with Alexa Fluor-555 (red fluorescence) was injected into the PnC (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a</xref>), revealing CTB-labelled neurons in prefrontal regions (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1b</xref>). The majority of labelled cells (92.78 %, 1053 of 1135 neurons; n = 3 mice) were found in layer V of the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) and the secondary motor cortex (M2; <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1c</xref>), whereas only 6.96 % and 0.26 % were found in other prefrontal sub-regions &#x02013; namely the ventral anterior cingulate cortex (vACC; with prelimbic cortex, PL) and the infralimbic cortex (IL), respectively. Hereafter, we refer to these neurons as the dACC&#x02192;PnC neurons.</p><p id="P5">To investigate the role of dACC&#x02192;PnC neurons in breathing control, we used a projection-specific labelling strategy to express the light-driven actuator, Channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2), in the dACC. A retrograde adeno-associated viral vector encoding Cre recombinase (AAVretro-Cre) was unilaterally injected into the PnC. Another AAV vector that expresses ChR2 (fused with eYFP; AAV-DIO-ChR2-eYFP; n = 6) or green fluorescence protein (for control group; AAV-DIO-eGFP; n = 5) in the presence of Cre was bilaterally injected into the dACC (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1d</xref>). This resulted in the successful expression of eYFP or ChR2-eYFP in the dACC (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1e</xref>). Consistent with our tracing results (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1c</xref>), only layer V neurons in the dACC/M2 regions were labelled with eYFP. To eliminate confounding effects of locomotion on breathing, these mice were carefully anesthetized and placed in a stereotaxic frame, and breathing was monitored using inductance plethysmography (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1f</xref>). Baseline breathing rate under light anesthesia was ~200 breaths per minute (BPM). Notably, photoactivation of the dACC&#x02192;PnC neurons significantly reduced the breathing rate in the ChR2 group to below 170 BPM on average (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1g</xref> and <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">1h</xref> left). No change in breathing rate was observed for controls (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1h</xref> left). Based on these results, we hypothesized that dACC&#x02192;PnC neurons are cortical breathing modulators that induce slow breathing upon activation. The same mice were also tested in a slightly deeper anesthetic state, where the baseline breathing rate was 150 BPM. Interestingly, no change in breathing rate was observed in both the ChR2 and control groups in response to dACC&#x02192;PnC neuronal activation (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 h</xref> right), suggesting that this cortical breathing circuit, unlike pontomedullary breathing centers, cannot override homeostatic respiratory controls and may function only above a certain homeostatic threshold.</p><p id="P6">Based on our search of the Allen Mouse Brain Atlas, we predicted that dACC neurons target GABAergic inhibitory neurons in the PnC (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Extended data Fig. 1</xref>). To test this idea, we performed anterograde tracing using serotype 1-packaged AAV (AAV1), which travels to efferent (downstream) neurons in a trans-synaptic manner<sup><xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup>. An AAV1 vector encoding Cre recombinase (AAV1-Cre) was injected into the dACC (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1i</xref>) and AAV-DIO-eGFP was injected into the PnC. The result was sparse but successful expression of eGFP in PnC neurons (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1j</xref>; 90 cells in 3 mice). To determine which types of cells were labelled, we immunolabelled PnC coronal sections with antibodies against GAD67, a marker of GABAergic cells. In total, 72 of 90 cells (80%) were co-labelled with eGFP and GAD67 (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1k</xref> and <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">1l</xref>), indicating that dACC neurons project to inhibitory neurons in the PnC.</p><p id="P7">We next tested the role of PnC GABAergic neurons (PnC<sup>GABA</sup>) in breathing control using optogenetics. We injected AAV-DIO-ChR2-eYFP (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1m</xref> and <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">1n</xref>), AAV-DIO-eNpHR3.0 (an AAV that expresses halorhodopsin-3.0 in the presence of Cre; <xref rid="F7" ref-type="fig">Extended data Fig. 2a</xref>), or control AAV-DIO-eGFP into the PnC of <italic toggle="yes">Vgat-ires-Cre</italic> transgenic mice, which express Cre in GABAergic neurons. During testing of lightly anesthetized mice, breathing rhythms were monitored using inductance plethysmography (baselines of 200 or 150 BPM). When photostimulation was applied, a dramatic decrease in breathing rate was observed in the ChR2 group for both breathing baseline conditions (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1o</xref> and <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">1p</xref>), whereas the control group exhibited no change. Conversely, an increase in breathing rate was observed when PnC<sup>GABA</sup> neurons were photoinhibited via eNpHR3.0 (<xref rid="F7" ref-type="fig">Extended data Fig. 2a</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="F7" ref-type="fig">d</xref>). These data indicate that PnC<sup>GABA</sup> neurons are inhibitory regulators of breathing rhythm, and their activation slows breathing. Therefore, inputs from the prefrontal area (dACC/M2) to the PnC comprise a top-down modulatory circuit that induces slow breathing.</p></sec><sec id="S2"><title>Neuronal activity correlates with breathing changes during purposeful behaviors</title><p id="P8">Breathing can be profoundly controlled by behavior. In particular, behaviors that require oropharyngeal activities and airway protection can perturb or entrain breathing cycles<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup>. We hypothesized that dACC&#x02192;PnC neurons and their downstream PnC<sup>GABA</sup> targets respond to purposeful behaviors that require synchronization of breathing, such as drinking. While coordination of breathing and swallowing behavior is generally controlled by trigeminal reflexes<sup><xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup>, accumulating evidence suggests that apnea during drinking also involves inputs from high-order cortices<sup><xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup>. For example, distinct breathing patterns are seen during conscious drinking and unconscious swallowing<sup><xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup>, and neuroimaging studies have revealed that the dACC and supplementary motor area (SMA) are activated during the oral/preparatory phase before swallowing<sup><xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P9">To monitor breathing signals in freely behaving mice, we implanted a micro-thermistor sensor into the nasal cavity<sup><xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup> (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2a</xref>). Temperature difference between inspiratory and expiratory breathing cycles was converted into voltage signals by the sensor. To simultaneously monitor breathing rhythms and dACC&#x02192;PnC neuronal activity (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2a</xref> and <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">2c</xref>), the same group of mice received another round of surgery to express the calcium-activity indicator jGCaMP7s. Similar to <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1d</xref>, AAVretro-Cre vector was injected into the PnC, and another AAV carrying a Cre-dependent jGCaMP7s cassette (AAV-FLEX-jGCaMP7s) was unilaterally injected into the dACC (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2c</xref>). We monitored breathing and calcium signals in mice as they voluntarily drank water (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2b</xref>). dACC&#x02192;PnC neurons were transiently activated upon the oral phase of drinking behavior, which was defined as the moment a bolus of water was taken into the mouth cavity (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2d</xref> and <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">2e</xref>). Downstream PnC<sup>GABA</sup> neuronal activity was monitored using transgenic mice (<italic toggle="yes">Vgat-ires-Cre</italic>) that express the jGCaMP7s indicator in the PnC (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2f</xref>). Similarly, prominent increases in PnC<sup>GABA</sup> neuronal activity were observed during drinking events (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2g</xref> and <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">2h</xref>). Therefore, consistent with previous human studies, our results demonstrate that a top-down breathing circuit and its downstream targets are activated during drinking behaviors to coordinate breathing rhythms.</p><p id="P10">We next monitored breathing rhythms and dACC&#x02192;PnC or PnC<sup>GABA</sup> neuronal activity during other behaviors that involve oropharyngeal activities, namely swimming, squeaking (vocalization), and sniffing (<xref rid="F8" ref-type="fig">Extended data Fig. 3</xref>). Two types of swimming tests were performed. Mice were briefly submerged in water (1&#x02013;2) and then either immediately removed from the water (withdrawal test) or allowed to swim after release. During the withdrawal test (<xref rid="F8" ref-type="fig">Extended data Fig. 3a</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="F8" ref-type="fig">e</xref>), apneic breathing cycles were observed only during submersion and fast breathing cycles resumed after withdrawal. Consistent with these breathing changes, short (~2 s) increases in dACC&#x02192;PnC and PnC<sup>GABA</sup> neuronal activity were induced during submersion and decreases in neuronal activity were observed after withdrawal. The release/swim test resulted in dramatic changes in breathing patterns with repeated apneic cycles (<xref rid="F8" ref-type="fig">Extended data Fig. 3f</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="F8" ref-type="fig">j</xref>). Both dACC&#x02192;PnC and PnC<sup>GABA</sup> neurons showed sustained increases in calcium signals, revealing a correlation between neuronal activity and slow-apneic breathing cycles. While the extent to which the cerebral cortex modulates breathing rhythms during swimming is not yet fully understood (due to technical limitations), evidence from humans and rats suggests that the activation of prefrontal and motor cortical regions may be involved in controlling breathing during swimming. Our data are consistent with top-down pathways helping to modulate breathing rhythms during swimming, working in combination with the well-established trigeminal diving reflex.</p><p id="P11">Finally, we monitored the activity of dACC&#x02192;PnC neurons during foot shock-induced vocalization or sniffing. Shock-induced vocalizations (squeaks) were only seen during slow expiratory breathing cycles, resulting in a decrease in breathing rate. Notably, these vocalizations were associated with an increase in dACC&#x02192;PnC activity, again revealing a correlation between activation of these neurons and slow breathing rate (<xref rid="F8" ref-type="fig">Extended data Fig. 3k</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="F8" ref-type="fig">n</xref>). In contrast to drinking, swimming, and squeaking, which require slow or apneic breathing cycles, sniffing is a behavior that results in faster breathing cycles (as much as 600 BPM). Following contact with an object and the onset of sniffing, decreased dACC&#x02192;PnC neuronal activity was observed. Rebound-like activation was then observed upon the termination of sniffing (<xref rid="F8" ref-type="fig">Extended data Fig. 3o</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="F8" ref-type="fig">r</xref>). These data suggest that dACC&#x02192;PnC neurons receive inhibitory inputs when the animal is engaged in fast-breathing behavior (<xref rid="F8" ref-type="fig">Extended data Fig. 3o</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="F8" ref-type="fig">r</xref>).</p><p id="P12">Taken together, data acquired using the nasally implanted thermistor sensor revealed that activity patterns of the dACC&#x02192;PnC pathway are tightly correlated with changes in breathing patterns during behaviors that require coordinated changes in breathing. While many of these behaviors are controlled by somatic and trigeminal reflexes, our findings suggest that a top-down, slow-breathing pathway is also involved in regulating the behavioral entrainment of breathing, presumably operating at different stages of the entrainment process.</p></sec><sec id="S3"><title>dACC&#x02192;PnC activity correlates with emotionally evoked breathing changes</title><p id="P13">Hyperventilation and shortness of breath are prominent symptoms of anxiety and panic disorders in humans<sup><xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup>, whereas long, slow breaths or mindfulness skills can help alleviate anxiety<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup>. We next investigated how dACC&#x02192;PnC neurons respond to anxiety-provoking environments and how these responses correlate with behavior and breathing patterns. We recorded calcium responses and breathing (as in <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2a</xref>) while mice were placed in an elevated plus maze (EPM; <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3a</xref>). All mice tested (n = 6) exhibited an increase in breathing rate while in exposed areas (center or open arms) compared to when they were in closed arms (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3b</xref>). Consistent with our previous study<sup><xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup>, we found a precise correlation between the location of the mouse and its breathing rate (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3c</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">f</xref>). We observed slow breathing cycles after &#x0201c;escape&#x0201d; events &#x02013; when a mouse moved from an exposed area to a closed arm (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3e</xref> and <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">3f</xref>). Increases in dACC&#x02192;PnC activity were also observed during these escape events (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3d</xref>), revealing a correlation between slow breathing cycles and increased dACC&#x02192;PnC neuronal activity. A detailed analysis of breathing phases further revealed that elongation of the expiratory phase (post-inspiration through expiration) contributed to the slower breathing rate (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3g</xref>).</p><p id="P14">We further analyzed dACC&#x02192;PnC activity patterns during the voluntary exploration of open arms. During each episode, the change in dACC&#x02192;PnC neuronal activity was calculated by subtracting the calcium level at open-arm entry from the calcium level at open-arm exit (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3h</xref>). This revealed an interesting correlation between neuronal activity and mouse behavior in the open arms. Prominent decreases in dACC&#x02192;PnC activity were observed when mice failed to reach the end of the open arm, but instead quickly returned to the center (refrained behavior, <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3j</xref>). By contrast, neuronal activity persisted or gradually increased in most episodes (80%) in which the mouse fully explored the open arm (full exploration, <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3k</xref> and <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">3l</xref>). These analyses reveal a correlation between the response of dACC&#x02192;PnC neurons and anxiety-related behaviors. In another set of experiments, mice were exposed to a similar but inescapable anxiogenic environment (<xref rid="F9" ref-type="fig">Extended data Fig. 4</xref>). For these experiments, mice were placed in a closed cylinder on an elevated platform and then the cylinder was removed to expose them to height. This exposure elicited a steep increase in breathing rate (reaching ~600 BPM) and a concurrent decrease in dACC&#x02192;PnC activity (<xref rid="F9" ref-type="fig">Extended data Fig. 4</xref>).</p><p id="P15">Taken together, these experiments show that dACC&#x02192;PnC neuronal activity is correlated with breathing and behavior in anxiety-provoking environments. Specifically, we observed increases in dACC&#x02192;PnC neuronal activity during escape events, which were coupled with slow breathing cycles characterized by longer exhales. dACC&#x02192;PnC activity decreased in anxiogenic environments (open arms of an elevated plus maze or an elevated platform). However, persistent dACC&#x02192;PnC activity was observed when mice overcame an anxiogenic condition and fully explored the environment, suggesting that increased dACC&#x02192;PnC activity promotes relief from anxiety.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>The dACC&#x02192;PnC circuit alleviates anxiety-like behaviors</title><p id="P16">Our calcium imaging results revealed that dACC&#x02192;PnC neuronal activity was inhibited by anxiety-provoking environments, whereas neuronal activity persisted when mice overcame an anxiogenic condition. We therefore hypothesized that artificial activation of dACC&#x02192;PnC neurons would suppress anxiety-like behaviors in mice and drive exploratory behaviors. To selectively activate dACC&#x02192;PnC neurons in anxiety tests, we used the same viral strategy as in <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1d</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">e</xref> to bilaterally express ChR2 in dACC&#x02192;PnC neurons (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4a</xref>). We first performed a control test using a real-time place preference (RTPP) paradigm, which does not promote anxiety-like behaviors but instead reveals potential changes in valence (see the <xref rid="S7" ref-type="sec">Methods</xref> section for details regarding the RTPP paradigm). During the second epoch of testing (minute 10&#x02013;20 of a 30-min session), light stimulation was applied when the mouse was in one chamber of a two-chamber box. Following this stimulation, neither the ChR2 nor control groups displayed preference or aversion for the light-paired chamber (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4b</xref>), indicating that dACC&#x02192;PnC activation does not alter valence. As a second control test, one chamber of the two-chamber box was paired with the odor of a female mouse cage to provoke male-approach behavior. Male mice showed strong preference for the odor-paired chamber, and this behavior was not altered by photoactivation (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4c</xref>). Next, these mice were tested in an aversive environment where one side of a cage was paired with fox anogenital odor &#x02013; trimethylthiazoline (TMT)<sup><xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup>. Mice avoided the TMT odor, but this avoidance was abolished by dACC&#x02192;PnC photostimulation in the ChR2 group but not in controls (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4d</xref>). Similar results were seen for other tests that probe behaviors associated with fear and anxiety, such as the elevated plus maze test (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4e</xref>), the looming-hiding task<sup><xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup>, and the light-dark choice test (<xref rid="F10" ref-type="fig">Extended data Fig. 5</xref>). Photostimulation of the ChR2 group increased exploration of the open arms in the EPM test (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4e</xref>) and exposed regions of each test arena. Taken together, these results show that activation of dACC&#x02192;PnC neurons consistently alleviates anxiety-like responses to aversive stimuli without altering valence or approach behaviors.</p><p id="P17">We then sought to characterize the circuit that acts downstream of dACC&#x02192;PnC neurons to promote anxiolysis. We reasoned that dACC&#x02192;PnC projections could drive changes in both breathing rate and emotion. Alternatively, dACC&#x02192;PnC projections could control breathing, whereas axon collaterals of these neurons could target other downstream regions to alleviate negative affect. We found that dACC&#x02192;PnC neurons send putative collaterals to several other regions, including the dorsal striatum, the mediodorsal and ventral midline thalamic nuclei, the zona incerta, and the deep mesencephalic nucleus of the midbrain (<xref rid="F11" ref-type="fig">Extended data Fig. 6</xref>). Using mice that express ChR2-eYFP in dACC&#x02192;PnC neurons, we photostimulated axon collaterals within the zona incerta (ZI; <xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4f</xref>), a brain region known to regulate fear- and anxiety-related responses in mice<sup><xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup>. This did not affect anxiety-like behavior in the elevated plus maze test (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4g</xref>). By contrast, stimulating terminals within the PnC increased the time spent exploring the open arm (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4h</xref> and <xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">4i</xref>). Using mice that express eNpHR3.0-eYFP in dACC&#x02192;PnC neurons, we asked whether inhibiting dACC&#x02192;PnC projections affected anxiety-like behavior (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4j</xref>). No changes in behaviors were observed in control tests, namely the real-time place aversion or female odor preference tests (<xref rid="F12" ref-type="fig">Extended data Fig. 7</xref>). In the EPM test, however, photoinhibition of dACC&#x02192;PnC terminals reduced time spent exploring the open arm (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4k</xref>). Taken together, these results indicate that dACC&#x02192;PnC projections are important for controlling anxiety-related responses in threatening environments.</p><p id="P18">Given these results, we next characterized the downstream projections of PnC<sup>GABA</sup> neurons. Using <italic toggle="yes">Vgat-ires-Cre</italic> transgenic mice that express ChR2-eYFP in the PnC, we found eYFP-labelled axons in a wide range of medullary structures (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4l</xref>) covering the dorsolateral and ventrolateral medulla (DLM and VLM), as well as the shell of the external parabrachial nucleus (PBel<sup>Shell</sup>) in the pons, regions critically involved in pneumotaxic and rhythmogenic control of breathing<sup><xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup>. Importantly, eYFP-labelled fibers were also found in a few forebrain regions (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4m</xref>) including the lateral habenula (LHb), the paraventricular thalamic nucleus (PVT), and the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BST), structures implicated in fear and anxiety responses<sup><xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref></sup>.

To determine whether dACC&#x02192;PnC neurons coordinate breathing and behavior, we inhibited the dACC&#x02192;PnC circuit and assessed the effect on both breathing cycles and associated behaviors, namely drinking and anxiety-related behaviors. To photoinhibit projection terminals, surgical procedures were performed to express eNpHR3.0-eYFP (or control eGFP) in dACC&#x02192;PnC neurons (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5a</xref>). Fiber optic elements were implanted into the PnC region to deliver light stimuli, and thermistor sensors were implanted in the nasal cavity to simultaneously record breathing rhythms.</p><p id="P20">We first inhibited the dACC&#x02192;PnC circuit and assessed the impact on voluntary drinking and paired breathing cycles. After overnight dehydration, mice in both groups (eNpHR3.0-eYFP or control eGFP) drank successfully (i.e., took the water bolus into their mouth) when water droplets were presented for 20 s without light stimulation. On the first drinking episode during the light-ON session, both groups drank successfully, but in subsequent episodes the eNpHR3.0 group exhibited refusal behaviors and decreased drinking success compared to the control group (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5c</xref> and <xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">5d</xref>). Once trials were no longer paired with photoinhibition, drinking success rates for the eNpHR3.0 group recovered to &#x0003e; 70% by the third session (<xref rid="F13" ref-type="fig">Extended data Fig. 8</xref>). Drinking responses of the control group were highly successful (&#x0003e; 80%) throughout the testing session. To determine whether breathing was affected by photoinhibition, we analyzed breathing cycle lengths during drinking behavior (defined as &#x02212;100 to +500 ms from drinking; <xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig 5e</xref>). Compared to the control group, eNpHR3.0 mice exhibited shorter breathing cycles during drinking behavior (fewer breathing cycles that exceeded 300 ms and more breathing cycles of 100&#x02013;150 ms) (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5f</xref>). Importantly, the eNpHR3.0 group paired shorter apneic cycles with drinking episodes than controls (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig 5g</xref>). These data indicate that the dACC&#x02192;PnC circuit is required to successfully coordinate slow breathing cycles and voluntary drinking behavior. Thus, the trigeminal pathway mediates reflex responses during unconscious swallowing, whereas top-down pathways may play a critical role in the preparatory control of breathing cycles to ensure safe coordination.</p><p id="P21">Finally, to explore the effect of dACC&#x02192;PnC inhibition on anxiety-related behaviors, we utilized a light/dark choice model that probes anxiety-related states based on exploration of a light zone. We designed a light/dark testing chamber in which half of an open square arena was shaded (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5h</xref>). Mice could move freely between light and dark zones with minimal hinderance from patch cords used to monitor breathing and deliver light. While in the light zone, mice received 590-nm light stimuli to inhibit dACC&#x02192;PnC terminals. Notably, mice in the eNpHR3.0 group spent less time in the light zone compared to controls (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5i</xref> and <xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">5j</xref>). Consistent with this behavioral change, the eNpHR3.0 group exhibited a smaller proportion of slow breathing cycles (cycles slower than the median breathing rate throughout testing) when in the light zone (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5k</xref>), indicating that the dACC&#x02192;PnC circuit is required to induce slow breathing cycles to relieve anxiety. Taken together, these analyses demonstrate that the dACC&#x02192;PnC circuit is necessary to coordinate behaviors with slow breathing.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P22">Most breathing research has targeted brainstem networks that receive somatic input to maintain gas homeostasis (pH, blood O<sub>2</sub>, and CO<sub>2</sub> levels) and to generate rhythmic breath cycles through cranial and spinal motor pathways<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup>. Compared to these well-characterized networks in the deep brainstem, how cortical circuits and their projections modulate breathing rhythms remains poorly understood. Here we describe a prefrontal circuit that projects to inhibitory neurons in the pons, which in turn project widely to breathing centers in the pons and medulla. The dACC&#x02192;PnC circuit, along with downstream PnC<sup>GABA</sup> neurons, promote slow breathing cycles and respond to behaviors such as drinking to entrain slow/apneic breathing cycles. Taken together, here we report the discovery of a top-down brain circuit for the inhibitory control of breathing and the coordination of breathing and behavior.</p><p id="P23">It has been proposed that neurons in the primary motor cortex that bypass pontomedullary breathing circuits and project directly to the spinal cord (the corticospinal tract) are crucial for the volitional/behavioral control of breathing<sup><xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup>. However, this theory has limitations, as it is unclear how these cortical circuits would incorporate on-going functions of autonomous breathing circuits instead of interfering with them<sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup>. Moreover, accumulating evidence in mice and rats indicates that medullary and pontine neuronal responses are correlated with and required for the entrainment of breathing rhythms to sniffing behavior<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref></sup>. Multiple studies in a wide range of species (including cats, birds, and monkeys) report that the parabrachial nucleus of the pons plays a critical role in coordinating vocalizations and respiratory rhythms<sup><xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref></sup>. These behaviors are used to voluntary interact with objects, environments, and conspecifics, and thus must be tightly synchronized with behavioral status<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref></sup>. Therefore, it is unlikely that behavioral inputs simply bypass the pontomedullary networks. Instead, pontomedullary breathing networks are likely modulated by top-down inputs.</p><p id="P24">Various voluntary efforts to change breathing patterns (e.g., by emphasizing longer exhales or box breathing) are used to control emotions<sup><xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref></sup>. However, it is not fully understood how these practices modulate the internal state of the brain. One line of research explores changes in bodily states and feedback interoception. The thinking is that longer expiration (exhale) leads to a decreased heart rate via respiratory sinus arrhythmia<sup><xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref></sup>, which in turn affects the interoceptive perception of the heart rate<sup><xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref></sup>. Another line of research explores the role of medullary breathing centers themselves. Neurons in the preB&#x000f6;tzinger complex that express Cdh9 and Dbx1 respond to the inspiratory phase of breathing in mice<sup><xref rid="R45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref></sup>. These neurons project to noradrenergic neurons in the locus coeruleus. Therefore, fast or slow breathing rhythms may modulate the activity of noradrenergic neurons, which then influence the brain-wide state of arousal. Along with these bottom-up mechanisms, our current findings reveal a complementary mechanism in which a top-down breathing circuit is critical for controlling negative emotions. Inhibitory PnC neurons, which receive input from the anterior cingulate cortex, project to medullary breathing centers but also to anxiety-related regions in the forebrain. Given this connectivity, the alleviation of negative affect may occur simultaneously with volitional efforts to slow breathing cycles.</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>Methods</title><sec id="S8"><title>Mice</title><p id="P25">All procedures for animal surgical and behavioral experiments were approved by the institutional animal care and use committee (IACUC) of the Salk Institute according to NIH guidelines for animal experimentation.
