Arp2, a protein within the 7-membered Arp2/3 complex, is responsible for generating branched actin. Given its essential roles, Arp2 evolves under stringent sequence conservation throughout eukaryotic evolution. We unexpectedly discovered recurrent evolutionary diversification of Arp2 in <italic toggle="yes">Drosophila</italic>, yielding independently arising paralogs <italic toggle="yes">Arp2D</italic> in <italic toggle="yes">obscura</italic> species and <italic toggle="yes">Arp2D2</italic> in <italic toggle="yes">montium</italic> species. Both paralogs are unusually testis-enriched in expression relative to Arp2. We investigated whether their sequence divergence from canonical Arp2 led to functional specialization by replacing <italic toggle="yes">Arp2</italic> in <italic toggle="yes">D. melanogaster</italic> with either <italic toggle="yes">Arp2D</italic> or <italic toggle="yes">Arp2D2</italic>. Despite their divergence, we surprisingly found both complement Arp2&#x02019;s essential function in the soma, suggesting they have preserved the ability to polymerize branched actin even in a non-native species. However, we found that <italic toggle="yes">Arp2D</italic>-expressing males are subfertile and display many defects throughout sperm development. We pinpointed two highly diverged structural regions in Arp2D that contribute to these defects: subdomain 2 and the C-terminus. We expected that germline function would be rescued by replacing Arp2D&#x02019;s long and charged C-terminus with Arp2&#x02019;s short C-terminus, yet surprisingly, the essential somatic function of Arp2D was lost. Therefore, while Arp2D&#x02019;s structural divergence is incompatible with <italic toggle="yes">D. melanogaster</italic> sperm development, its unique C-terminus has evolved a critical role in actin polymerization. Our findings suggest canonical Arp2&#x02019;s function differs between somatic versus germline contexts, and Arp2 paralogs have recurrently evolved and specialized for actin branching in the testis.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>cytoskeleton</kwd><kwd>actin</kwd><kwd>Arp2</kwd><kwd>evolution</kwd><kwd>fertility</kwd><kwd>sperm development</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">The Arp2/3 complex is a highly conserved protein complex that nucleates branched actin networks and is found in almost all eukaryotes. The complex comprises seven proteins, consisting of two actin-related proteins, Arp2 and Arp3, and five other subunits, ArpC1-5. The complex docks onto a mother actin filament and promotes the nucleation of a daughter filament at a 70&#x000b0; angle from the mother filament<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup>. Arp2/3-generated branched actin networks are often found at the surface of cell membranes and are vital for many cellular processes, such as cell motility and endocytosis<sup><xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup>. These actin networks are mechanosensitive and respond to environmental cues by undergoing actin reorganization, implicating Arp2/3 in events such as cellular signaling and energetics<sup><xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup>. This complex also plays roles in genomic stability<sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> and cell division, particularly in proper chromosome segregation, spindle organization, and mitotic progression<sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup>. Finally, Arp2/3 also resides in the nucleus, where it aids in DNA damage repair<sup><xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P3">In addition to its many somatic roles, Arp2/3 has specialized roles in the germline. In <italic toggle="yes">Drosophila,</italic> Arp2/3 is required for generating actin structures found in ovaries<sup><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> and testes<sup><xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup>. <italic toggle="yes">Drosophila</italic> ovaries have actin structures known as ring canals, which are critical for successful oogenesis and allow cytoplasmic flow to the oocyte<sup><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup>. The Arp2/3 complex localizes to ring canals and is necessary for their expansion in late oogenesis<sup><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup>. <italic toggle="yes">Drosophila</italic> sperm development also depends on Arp2/3<sup><xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup>. <italic toggle="yes">Drosophila</italic> sperm develop together within cysts sharing a cytoplasm; mature sperm must be separated following their elongation and tail development<sup><xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup>. To accomplish this individualization process, an actin cone forms around each sperm within the cyst, and all cones move synchronously along the tail from the basal to the apical end of the testis<sup><xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup>. The Arp2/3 complex localizes to the front of the cones, and branched actin polymerization aids in motility<sup><xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P4">Recent studies have begun to reveal the structure and regulation of the Arp2/3 complex in mechanistic detail. Like actin, Arp2 and 3 contain four subdomains with an ATP-binding fold<sup><xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup>. Upon docking onto the mother actin filament, Arp2/3 undergoes a conformational change from inactive to active, in which Arp2 and Arp3 are no longer splayed but are aligned together, like actin monomers in a filament<sup><xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup>. This re-arrangement of Arps 2 and 3 allow them to become the first two subunits of the daughter actin filament<sup><xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup>. Arp2/3 cannot nucleate actin filaments on their own<sup><xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup>; instead, nucleation-promoting factors (NPFs) activate Arp2/3 downstream of many signaling pathways<sup><xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup>. Numerous regulatory factors terminate polymerization and disassemble filaments, replenishing the monomeric actin pool for future nucleation events<sup><xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup>. Filament nucleation, polymerization, termination, and disassembly are regulated by a myriad of proteins to fine-tune the timing and structural stability of branched actin networks<sup><xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup>, thus contributing to the diversity of Arp2/3&#x02019;s functional roles.</p><p id="P5">Eukaryotic genomes show genetic and functional diversification of the Arp2/3 complex. Humans encode two isoforms of Arp3 (Arp3 and Arp3B), ArpC1 (ArpC1A and ArpC1B), and ArpC5 (ArpC5 and ArpC5L)<sup><xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup>. Arp2/3 complexes containing ArpC1B and ArpC5L differ in their rates of actin polymerization from those containing ArpC1A and ArpC5<sup><xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup>. Although Arp3B functions similarly to canonical Arp3 in actin polymerization, it diverges from Arp3 in the rate of actin network disassembly<sup><xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup>. Like humans, <italic toggle="yes">Drosophila</italic> also exhibits diversification of the Arp2/3 complex. <italic toggle="yes">D. melanogaster</italic> encodes two isoforms of Arpc3 (Arpc3a and Arpc3b). Arpc3a is expressed in all tissues, whereas Arpc3b appears to be expressed only in the ovary and localizes to intercellular bridges known as actin rings<sup><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup>. Furthermore, an Arp2 paralog, known as Arp2D, emerged in one clade of <italic toggle="yes">Drosophila</italic> species. Arp2D is highly expressed in the male germline and localizes to branched actin networks in the front of actin cones<sup><xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup>. Arp2/3&#x02019;s key regulators also show diversification, allowing for differential regulation of Arp2/3 between cell types. Defects in the Arp2/3 regulatory system are implicated in disease<sup><xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup>. Therefore, despite Arp2/3&#x02019;s stringent conservation, multiple members of the Arp2/3 complex and its regulators have undergone recurrent gene duplication and diversification across phyla, suggesting that evolution is selecting for different &#x02018;flavors&#x02019; of Arp2/3 for specialized roles.</p><p id="P6">Here, we have discovered that recurrent diversification of Arp2 in <italic toggle="yes">Drosophila</italic> has led to functional specialization in the male germline. In addition to <italic toggle="yes">Arp2D</italic> found in the <italic toggle="yes">Drosophila obscura</italic> clade<sup><xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup>, we found a second, independently arising gene duplication of <italic toggle="yes">Arp2</italic> in the <italic toggle="yes">montium</italic> clade, named <italic toggle="yes">Arp2D2</italic>. Both Arp2D and Arp2D2 are exclusively expressed in the male germline of their respective species. Despite their striking sequence divergence, we found that Arp2D and Arp2D2 can polymerize actin in somatic tissues in the non-native species <italic toggle="yes">D. melanogaster</italic> and complement canonical Arp2&#x02019;s essential function in the soma. However, the more divergent Arp2D paralog cannot complement Arp2 function in sperm development, resulting in many testis defects. Arp2D diverges most from canonical Arp2 at the C-terminus and a loop found in subdomain 2. We found that both regions contribute to defects in germline function, yet the unique C-terminus of Arp2D is essential for its somatic function. These data reveal that evolution has shaped the Arp2 structure for specialized roles in spermatogenesis.</p></sec><sec id="S2"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Recurrent invention of testis-expressed Arp2 paralogs in <italic toggle="yes">Drosophila</italic> species</title><p id="P7">The seven-member Arp2/3 complex is present and evolves under stringent sequence constraints in most eukaryotes. However, the subunit Arp2 has undergone unexpected diversification via gene duplication. We previously discovered that an <italic toggle="yes">Arp2</italic> paralog, <italic toggle="yes">Arp2D</italic>, arose via retroduplication in the <italic toggle="yes">obscura</italic> clade and has been retained for over 14 million years<sup><xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup>. By examining additional sequenced <italic toggle="yes">Drosophila</italic> genomes, we found that <italic toggle="yes">D. kikkawai</italic><sup><xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup> and <italic toggle="yes">D. serrata</italic><sup><xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup>, species of the <italic toggle="yes">montium</italic> clade, also encoded an <italic toggle="yes">Arp2</italic> gene duplication found on chromosome 2 (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>). We named the newly discovered duplicate &#x02018;<italic toggle="yes">Arp2D2</italic>.&#x02019; We queried the <italic toggle="yes">Arp2D2</italic> locus by PCR in 18 additional <italic toggle="yes">montium</italic> species, whose genomes were unsequenced. Together with recently published <italic toggle="yes">montium</italic> genomes<sup><xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup>, we concluded that <italic toggle="yes">Arp2D2</italic> is present in a shared syntenic location in 27 <italic toggle="yes">montium</italic> species with no exceptions (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>, <xref rid="SD5" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure S1A</xref>, <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Data S1</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="SD3" ref-type="supplementary-material">3</xref>). Based on this, we conclude that <italic toggle="yes">Arp2D2</italic> arose in the common ancestor of the <italic toggle="yes">montium</italic> group at least 15 million years ago<sup><xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup> (<xref rid="SD5" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure S1A</xref>). Our phylogenetic analysis based on a nucleotide alignment shows that <italic toggle="yes">Arp2D2</italic> sequences form a monophyletic clade that is a well-supported sister clade to the <italic toggle="yes">montium Arp2</italic> orthologs (100% bootstrap support), further confirming <italic toggle="yes">Arp2D2</italic> duplicated from canonical <italic toggle="yes">Arp2</italic> in the common ancestor of the <italic toggle="yes">montium</italic> group (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>). <italic toggle="yes">Arp2D</italic> orthologs form a separate clade with its closest outgroup being <italic toggle="yes">obscura</italic> Arp2 sequences, supporting independent origins of the <italic toggle="yes">Arp2</italic> paralogs (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>). <italic toggle="yes">Arp2</italic> encodes six introns (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>), yet 26 of the 27 <italic toggle="yes">Arp2D2</italic> sequences have none (the <italic toggle="yes">D. diplacantha Arp2D2</italic> subsequently acquired one intron (<xref rid="SD5" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure S1B</xref>, <xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Data S2</xref>)). Therefore, our phylogenomic analyses reveal that <italic toggle="yes">Arp2D2</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">Arp2D</italic> both arose via independent retroduplication events in which Arp2&#x02019;s spliced mRNA was reverse transcribed and inserted into the genome<sup><xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup> (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">B</xref>). Subsequent to their origin, both <italic toggle="yes">Arp2D</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">Arp2D2</italic> have been retained throughout the <italic toggle="yes">obscura</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">montium</italic> clades, respectively, suggesting that they must confer a functional advantage to their native species.</p><p id="P8">Although independently derived from canonical <italic toggle="yes">Arp2</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">Arp2D</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">Arp2D2</italic> may have converged on similar sequence features associated with their testis-specific roles. However, we observed no conserved residue changes common to all Arp2D and Arp2D2 orthologs but distinct from canonical Arp2, suggesting the two duplicates had divergent evolutionary paths (<xref rid="SD5" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure S1C</xref>). Moreover, when we viewed the conserved residue changes on the surface of the Arp2 structure (where protein interactions occur), we did not find residue changes concentrating in one structural region, indicating no &#x02018;hot spot&#x02019; of diversification for Arp2D or Arp2D2 (<xref rid="SD5" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure S1C</xref>).</p><p id="P9"><italic toggle="yes">Arp2D</italic> exhibits testis-enriched expression, unlike the ubiquitously expressed canonical Arp2<sup><xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup>. We investigated whether <italic toggle="yes">Arp2D2</italic> also exhibits sex-biased expression. We compared the expression of <italic toggle="yes">Arp2D2</italic> mRNA between males and females in the <italic toggle="yes">montium</italic> species <italic toggle="yes">D. barbarae</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">D. bicornuta</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">D. watanabei</italic>, and <italic toggle="yes">D. auraria</italic> by RT-PCR analyses. We detected <italic toggle="yes">Arp2D2</italic> only in males (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>, <xref rid="SD5" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure S1D</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="SD5" ref-type="supplementary-material">E</xref>, <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Data S1</xref>). To determine if expression is localized to the testis, we extracted RNA from dissected <italic toggle="yes">D. auraria</italic> testes, separating them from the head and remaining male carcass.

Thus, two independent gene duplications of <italic toggle="yes">Arp2</italic> exhibit testis-enriched expression, suggesting recurrent <italic toggle="yes">Arp2</italic> diversification may have specifically acquired roles in sperm development.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Divergent Arp2 duplicates localize to actin in <italic toggle="yes">D. melanogaster</italic></title><p id="P10">Our previous study revealed that Arp2D, under the control of its endogenous promoter, localizes to actin in the testis of its native species, <italic toggle="yes">D. pseudoobscura</italic><sup><xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup>. However, it was unclear whether it could also do so in heterologous species like <italic toggle="yes">D. melanogaster</italic>. To investigate this possibility, we studied whether divergent <italic toggle="yes">D. pseudoobscura</italic> Arp2D (from the <italic toggle="yes">obscura</italic> group) or <italic toggle="yes">D. auraria</italic> Arp2D2 (from the <italic toggle="yes">montium</italic> group) could localize to actin in <italic toggle="yes">D. melanogaster</italic>. We generated <italic toggle="yes">D. melanogaster</italic> fly lines that express the paralogs tagged with superfolder GFP (sfGFP) at their C-termini (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>), where canonical Arp2 can be tagged without a noticeable impact on function<sup><xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup>. We expected the paralogs to be expressed in both germ cells and somatic cells because they are under the control of the endogenous Arp2 promoter (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>). Indeed, we found that Arp2D, Arp2D2, and canonical Arp2 from <italic toggle="yes">D. pseudoobscura</italic> were highly expressed and localized to actin cones in the testis, even in the presence of endogenous <italic toggle="yes">D. melanogaster</italic> Arp2 (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>). Actin cones are unique testis-specific actin structures that are specialized for <italic toggle="yes">Drosophila</italic> sperm development<sup><xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup>. In flies, germ cells remain interconnected throughout development until they are fully mature, and actin cones facilitate the separation of mature sperm<sup><xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>). Like canonical Arp2, which localizes to the front half of the cone to help produce the cone&#x02019;s typical fan shape, we observed Arp2D and Arp2D2 also localizing to the cone&#x02019;s front half (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>).

We next tested if the <italic toggle="yes">Arp2D</italic> and Arp2D2 paralogs could rescue the loss of <italic toggle="yes">D. melanogaster Arp2</italic>. For this, we first generated an <italic toggle="yes">Arp2-KO</italic> fly line by deleting the entire gene and replacing it with an eye-expressed <italic toggle="yes">DsRed</italic> cassette using CRISPR/Cas9 technology (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>). Upstream to <italic toggle="yes">DsRed</italic> in the KO locus, we introduced an <italic toggle="yes">attP</italic> site, which we subsequently used for targeted transgenesis (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>). As expected, our <italic toggle="yes">Arp2</italic>-KOs exhibited homozygous lethality. Because Arp2 is on the X chromosome, only heterozygous <italic toggle="yes">Arp2-KO</italic> females survived, whereas hemizygous <italic toggle="yes">Arp2-KO</italic> males did not.</p><p id="P12">We next inserted <italic toggle="yes">D. pseudoobscura Arp2D, D. auraria Arp2D2</italic>, or canonical <italic toggle="yes">D. melanogaster</italic> Arp2 (as a positive control) in the <italic toggle="yes">Arp2</italic>-KO locus to test for rescue. We used intronless <italic toggle="yes">D. melanogaster</italic> Arp2 because <italic toggle="yes">Arp2D</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">Arp2D2</italic> lack introns, and we wanted to prevent splicing differences from leading to any phenotypes. All transgenes were introduced using the same <italic toggle="yes">attP</italic> site; they all possess the same upstream and downstream ~1kb regions of <italic toggle="yes">D. melanogaster</italic> canonical Arp2, which included the 5&#x02019;- and 3&#x02019; UTRs (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>). Because Arp2D is only 70% identical to canonical Arp2, we expected Arp2D would fail to rescue lethality, whereas Arp2D2, being 96% identical, was likely to rescue. We were surprised to find that we were able to obtain homozygous females and hemizygous males expressing Arp2D or Arp2D2, suggesting both rescued the <italic toggle="yes">Arp2</italic>-KO lethality phenotype. However, whether the transgene fully rescued lethality or exhibited a fitness cost remained unclear. To address this question, we crossed females and males that encode for one copy of the transgene and quantified the progeny genotypes (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>). This scenario should lead to 50% of females having two copies of the transgene and 50% of males with one copy if there is no fitness cost. Indeed, we found that crossing both <italic toggle="yes">Arp2D</italic>- and <italic toggle="yes">Arp2D2</italic>-expressing flies led to at least 50% of the progeny being homozygous (female) or hemizygous (male) for the transgenes (p&#x0003c;0.05, <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>). The slight increase over the expected 50% suggests that the X-chromosome balancer (<italic toggle="yes">FM7</italic>) has a small fitness cost compared to the transgenes. We conclude that when canonical Arp2 is replaced with either Arp2D or Arp2D2, no loss of fitness is detected under laboratory conditions (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>). We further tested whether a fitness cost would become apparent under environmental stress. We conducted the same cross with the most divergent duplicate (Arp2D) under heat stress at 29&#x000b0;C and found complete rescue, suggesting no fitness cost in viability even under these conditions (<xref rid="SD5" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure S2A</xref>). We also did not notice any lifetime defects, abnormalities in morphology, or unusual behavior at room temperature or under heat stress.

Since males generally produce many sperm, one week of mating at room temperature may not readily reveal decreases in sperm count. Heat stress often exacerbates existing fertility defects, which become more detectable. We conducted the same male fertility assay as before, except at 29&#x000b0;C. We found that Arp2D-expressing males exhibited a significant decrease in adult progeny (p=0.02, <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D</xref>), indicating they are subfertile. We then directly assessed sperm production by measuring the size of the seminal vesicle, where mature sperm are stored<sup><xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup>. The area of the seminal vesicle scales with the number of stored mature sperm<sup><xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup>. We found that the average area of seminal vesicles from <italic toggle="yes">Arp2D</italic>-expressing males was significantly smaller than those from canonical Arp2-expressing males, whether they mated or not (p=0.009, <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3E</xref>; p=0.003, <xref rid="SD5" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure S2B</xref>). Therefore, <italic toggle="yes">Arp2D</italic>-expressing males produce less sperm and exhibit a fertility cost.

We next investigated whether this is due to a lack of expression of Arp2D in ovaries. We imaged ovaries from wildtype <italic toggle="yes">D. melanogaster</italic> flies expressing GFP-tagged Arp2D and detected no Arp2D protein expression (<xref rid="SD5" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure S3B</xref>).

Sperm development can be tracked spatially in the fly testis (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>). Germline stem cells are at the apical end, where they differentiate and progress through mitosis, meiosis, and sperm maturation. After sperm elongation, sperm are separated by a process known as individualization, which is powered by actin cones. Fly testes appear morphologically as tubes coiled at the basal end, where individualizing sperm are found (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>). We were surprised that <italic toggle="yes">Arp2D</italic>-expressing testes exhibited a striking morphological defect in testis morphology (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>).

We quantified the number of waste bags (identified by actin cone degradation) and found that the number of waste bags per testis was significantly increased (p=0.005, <xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4H</xref>).

Our studies reveal recurrent Arp2 gene duplication and subsequent sequence diversification in <italic toggle="yes">Drosophila</italic>.

We find that Arp2 may have conflicting roles between its &#x02018;housekeeping&#x02019; functions in somatic tissue and those in sperm development, and the optimal Arp2 sequence for somatic roles may result in a fitness cost in the germline. This tension can be relieved with a germline-specific Arp2 paralog. Surprisingly, evolution has selected for a testis-specific Arp2 paralog twice, suggesting a recurrent need for an Arp2 that is specialized for male germline roles. Arp2D2 and Arp2D&#x02019;s sequence and functional differences suggest they have evolved uniquely for Arp2&#x02019;s spermatogenic roles specific to their respective species. Although we found no fertility cost in <italic toggle="yes">Arp2D2</italic>-expressing <italic toggle="yes">D. melanogaster</italic> flies, Arp2D2 may have a subtle deviation from canonical Arp2&#x02019;s function.

The kinetics of complex assembly or Arp2D-catalyzed actin polymerization may be changed. Alternatively, the Arp2D/3 complex may lead to branched actin networks that are unstable or hyper-stable. There is precedence for diversification of Arp2/3 complexes leading to an impact on polymerization rate (gene duplicates of ArpC1 and ArpC5<sup><xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup>) or network stability (gene duplicate of human Arp3<sup><xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup>).

Canonical Arp2&#x02019;s subdomain 2 loop has limited structural information, partly due to its flexibility and lack of electron density in high-resolution structures<sup><xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup>. However, we have a few clues about the functional impact of subdomain 2. In canonical Arps 2 and 3, it faces towards the mother actin filament<sup><xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref></sup>.

Because our study shows Arp2D&#x02019;s subdomain 2 is incompatible with <italic toggle="yes">D. melanogaster</italic> sperm development, this structural region carries functional importance and may enable critical interactions with actin that impact kinetics like Arp3&#x02019;s loop. Interestingly, canonical Arp2&#x02019;s subdomain 2 undergoes alternative splicing, resulting in two splice variants differing only by five amino acids<sup><xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>,<xref rid="R45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref></sup> (<xref rid="SD5" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure S5A</xref>). Although nothing is known about the distinct functions of Arp2&#x02019;s splice isoforms, we speculate that modulation of Arp2&#x02019;s subdomain 2 can tune actin polymerization for different contexts, and perhaps Arp2D has evolved a divergent loop that specializes polymerization kinetics specifically for sperm development in <italic toggle="yes">obscura</italic> species.</p><p id="P25">We also find that Arp2D&#x02019;s C-terminus is incompatible with <italic toggle="yes">D. melanogaster</italic> sperm development. Because canonical Arp2 can be C-terminally tagged without perturbing activity<sup><xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup> or localization (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>), the functional impact of Arp2D&#x02019;s C-terminus on Arp2 likely depends on sequence and not length. Unlike subdomain 2, much less is known about the role of canonical Arp2&#x02019;s C-terminus in actin polymerization and how altering its sequence may impact function. However, a major clue comes again from Arp3 studies. Arp3&#x02019;s C-terminal tail serves an autoinhibitory role by binding the hydrophobic groove between subdomains 1 and 3, keeping the Arp2/3 complex in an inactive conformation until ATP<sup><xref rid="R46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref></sup> or a nucleation-promoting factor (WASP)<sup><xref rid="R47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref></sup> binds. Analogously, it would seem Arp2D&#x02019;s C-terminus may be inhibitory, yet this domain is highly charged and unlikely to bind the hydrophobic groove of Arp2. Instead, Arp2D&#x02019;s C-terminus may alter charge-charge interactions with regulators critical for actin polymerization in <italic toggle="yes">D. melanogaster</italic> individualization.</p><p id="P26">Despite its negative impact on sperm development, Arp2D&#x02019;s unique C-terminus is surprisingly required for Arp2D&#x02019;s somatic function. Because the C-terminus is predicted to be unstructured, removing it is unlikely to make the protein less stable and, therefore, must be required for Arp2D protein function. The N-terminal domain composing the majority of Arp2D appears structurally like canonical Arp2 based on homology predictions; thus, we expected this domain would be sufficient to interact with actin and the rest of the Arp2/3 complex for actin polymerization. However, because the unique C-terminus is required for somatic function, we infer that Arp2D&#x02019;s C-terminus has co-evolved with the &#x02018;Arp2-like&#x02019; N-terminal domain and is now integral for full-length protein activity, yet incompatible with the evolutionarily older canonical Arp2 sequence for testis function. The C-terminus may directly stimulate Arp2D for nucleation activity or have acquired a regulator binding site. Interestingly, Arp2D orthologs&#x02019; C-termini vary in length and overall charge (<xref rid="SD5" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure S5A</xref>). We speculate that each ortholog&#x02019;s C-terminus has co-evolved with its respective &#x02018;Arp2-like&#x02019; domain, which has led to species-specialized germline function. Because the <italic toggle="yes">obscura</italic> species retain canonical Arp2, Arp2D had the opportunity to evolutionarily explore new sequences and roles in sperm development without compromising viability, as canonical Arp2 preserved somatic function.</p><p id="P27">The question remains why Arp2 has recurrently specialized exclusively for testis function.
