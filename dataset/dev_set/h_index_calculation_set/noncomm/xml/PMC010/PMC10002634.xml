One limitation of standard cell culture is a reliance on non-physiological nutrient levels to propagate cells. Which nutrients are available can influence how cancer cells use metabolism to proliferate and impact sensitivity to some drugs, but a general assessment of how physiological nutrients affect cancer cell response to small molecule therapies is lacking. To enable screening of compounds to determine how the nutrient environment impacts drug efficacy, we developed a serum-derived culture medium that supports the proliferation of diverse cancer cell lines and is amenable to high-throughput screening. We used this system to screen several small molecule libraries and found that compounds targeting metabolic enzymes were enriched as having differential efficacy in standard compared to serum-derived medium. We exploited the differences in nutrient levels between each medium to understand why medium conditions affected the response of cells to some compounds, illustrating how this approach can be used to screen potential therapeutics and understand how their efficacy is modified by available nutrients.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p id="P5">Studies of cancer cells in standard culture conditions have long been used as a tractable tool for drug discovery. Cell culture provides unparalleled experimental flexibility, scalability, and low cost to identify and understand the response to cancer therapeutics; however, drug responses in culture are not always predictive of drug response in animal models or in patients<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup>. A limitation of standard culture systems that may contribute to this phenomenon is a failure to model many of the cell-extrinsic factors that influence tumor growth and progression, including cancer cell interactions with immune cells<sup><xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup>, stromal cells<sup><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup>, and the extracellular matrix<sup><xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup>. Additionally, it is becoming increasingly apparent that nutrient availability can influence the response to some drugs<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup>. For example, most cancer cells are sensitive to inhibitors of the metabolic enzyme glutaminase when cultured in standard media<sup><xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup>, but become resistant to glutaminase inhibitors when cultured in serum-like media<sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> or when grown as tumors in mice<sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup>. Similarly, cancer cells were found to be protected from 5-fluorouracil efficacy when cultured in the presence of physiologically relevant levels of the purine catabolism end product uric acid<sup><xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P6">Culturing cancer cells in media containing more physiological levels of defined nutrients is an approach that is tractable and has been shown to affect metabolism and alter sensitivity to some drugs in a manner that may better reflect the responses of tumors in mice<sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup>. However, while synthetic culture media have the advantage of nutrients being supplied at known concentrations, they lack the biological complexity of nutrients present in blood and tissues. This includes the absence of many lipid species and undefined low abundance metabolites. An alternative approach for culturing cells in more physiological nutrient levels is the use of biological fluids as a culture medium<sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup>, since these fluids contain all nutrients present in the animal. Additionally, culturing cells in animal-derived serum is cost effective, and has recently been used to understand mechanisms of drug sensitivity and resistance to glutaminase inhibitors<sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup>. The biological complexity of nutrients present in serum may be of particular interest for phenotypic drug screening to identify compounds with anticancer activity, as some may target pathways involving micronutrients or lipid metabolism that are less well modeled in defined media.</p><p id="P7">Screening approaches to find candidate compounds whose efficacy is impacted by available nutrients could complement existing screens using standard media, and might identify hits that would otherwise be masked by non-physiological nutrient levels. In this study, we optimize a system for screening in serum-based conditions that is amenable for culture of &#x0003e;482 cancer cell lines and allows for testing differential drug sensitivity in a high-throughput format. Using this system to screen several small molecule libraries, we find that inhibitors of metabolic proteins show differential efficacy between standard and more physiologic nutrient conditions, and illustrate how these differences may be explained mechanistically. We therefore demonstrate how the use of a serum-based medium may be utilized as a tool for drug discovery.</p></sec><sec id="S2"><title>RESULTS</title><sec id="S3"><title>Characterization of a serum-derived culture medium optimized for high-throughput screening</title><p id="P8">To facilitate high-throughput compound screening in cells cultured in serum-based media conditions, we first optimized ABS to allow for direct cell plating and subsequent growth in 1536-well plates. As previously observed<sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup>, cancer cells seeded directly into culture plates in 100% ABS exhibited poor attachment; additionally, we found dispensing ABS through automated reagent dispensers led to clogging of those systems. We hypothesized that high protein content in ABS contributed to low cell attachment<sup><xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup>. Therefore, we performed ultrafiltration with a 10 kDa filter to reduce protein content and collected the small molecule-containing filtrate, which we termed basal flow-through ABS (ftABS<sup>B</sup>) (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure S1A</xref>, <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">B</xref>). To assess how levels of metabolites were altered due to ultrafiltration, we performed quantitative metabolomics<sup><xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup> as well as untargeted metabolomics of ABS and ftABS<sup>B</sup>. ftABS<sup>B</sup> maintained most polar metabolites at similar levels to those found in 100% ABS (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>, <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1C</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">D</xref>, and <xref rid="SD3" ref-type="supplementary-material">Table S1</xref>). Additionally, while some lipid species were lost during ultrafiltration, many were retained including some that are not present in synthetic media (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure S1E</xref> and <xref rid="SD3" ref-type="supplementary-material">Table S1</xref>). After supplementing the ABS ultrafiltrate with 10% dialyzed FBS as a growth factor source, we obtained a media we termed ftABS<sup>B+F</sup> that allowed cancer cells to attach to culture dishes when directly plated using automated reagent dispensers.</p><p id="P9">When culturing A549 cells in ftABS<sup>B+F</sup>, we observed that cells proliferated slower in this medium than they did in RPMI (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure S1F</xref>). Consistent with previous measurements<sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup>, cystine is present at sub-physiologic levels in both ABS and ftABS<sup>B</sup> (as compared to 25&#x02013;100 &#x003bc;M in adult human plasma<sup><xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup>, <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref> and <xref rid="SD3" ref-type="supplementary-material">Table S1</xref>). Restoring cystine in ftABS<sup>B+F</sup> to a more physiologically relevant concentration of 25 &#x003bc;M resulted in a medium we termed ftABS<sup>B+FC</sup> that supported proliferation of A549 cells at rates that approached those observed in RPMI (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure S1F</xref>).</p><p id="P10">Despite cystine addition, cells cultured in ftABS<sup>B+FC</sup> stopped proliferating after two days unless the medium was refreshed daily (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure S1G</xref>), suggesting one or more metabolites may become depleted below a critical threshold over time in culture. We examined whether daily media changes were feasible for high-throughput screening, but observed variable cell losses in 1536-well plates with media replacement, regardless of whether various approaches were used to promote improved cell attachment (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure S1H</xref>). Thus, to overcome this limitation and allow screening periods of more than 2 days, we next considered which metabolites may become limiting for cell proliferation in ftABS, or if the ratio of culture volume to cell number could be adjusted to prevent metabolite depletion over a longer assay period. Glutamine is avidly consumed by cancer cells in vitro<sup><xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup>, and given its sub-physiologic concentration of 100 &#x003bc;M in ftABS<sup>B</sup> (as compared to ~500 &#x003bc;M in adult human plasma<sup><xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup>, <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref> and <xref rid="SD3" ref-type="supplementary-material">Table S1</xref>), we hypothesized that it may be limiting for proliferation. To test this hypothesis, and to identify other nutrients that may become limiting, we analyzed metabolite consumption by A549 cells cultured in different volumes of RPMI or ftABS<sup>B+FC</sup> and found that glutamine was indeed depleted or nearly depleted after three days (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure S2A</xref>). Also consistent with nutrient depletion in ftABS, the falloff in proliferation rate of A549 cells in ftABS<sup>B+FC</sup> over time could be suppressed by culture in a larger volume of media (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure S2B</xref>). We therefore supplemented ftABS<sup>B+FC</sup> with an additional 400 &#x003bc;M glutamine to more closely match the human physiologic range, and found that it improved stable rates of cell proliferation over a longer period of time without media change (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure S1I</xref>). This final, complete version of media we used for screening is henceforth referred to as ftABS, and we further optimized the cell plating density to allow for exponential cell proliferation over the course of three days in ftABS medium (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure S1J</xref>).</p><p id="P11">We next tested whether ftABS could be used as a culture medium to screen diverse cancer cell lines. Utilizing the PRISM screening platform, in which 482 barcoded cancer cell lines are co-cultured over several days<sup><xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup>, we found that most cell lines display a similar relative proliferation when cultured in ftABS compared to RPMI (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref> and <xref rid="SD3" ref-type="supplementary-material">Table S2</xref>). We also assessed the proliferation rate of individual human and murine cancer cells and found that a diverse set of cell lines all proliferated in ftABS, in many cases exhibiting minimal differences in proliferation rates when cultured in ftABS compared to RPMI (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure S2C</xref>). These data indicate that ftABS contains metabolites at sufficient levels to support the proliferation of many cancer cell lines from diverse tissues of origin over a time period amenable to high-throughput screening.</p><p id="P12">We next verified that culturing cells in ftABS recapitulates the reduced sensitivity to the glutaminase inhibitor CB-839 that was previously observed when cells were cultured in 100% ABS<sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup>, providing a positive control for differential drug sensitivity in screens involving ftABS compared to standard culture medium. Indeed, A549 cells treated with CB-839 were sensitive to this inhibitor when cultured in RPMI but were insensitive when cultured in ftABS (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>). Altogether, these data demonstrate that ftABS is a serum-based culture medium that supports the growth of most cancer cell lines and allows for high-throughput compound screening.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Compounds targeting metabolism are differentially enriched in cells cultured in standard versus serum-derived medium</title><p id="P13">Next, we investigated how culturing A549 cells in RPMI versus ftABS affects response to a drug screening library containing 3,491 compounds with annotated mechanisms of action<sup><xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup>. We found that the efficacy of most compounds in the library was highly correlated for cells cultured in RPMI compared to ftABS (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>), indicating that the effects of most compounds in this library are not altered by environmental nutrient levels. Of the compounds with differential efficacy in the screen, we noted many of them were annotated to target metabolic enzymes. To assess whether compounds targeting metabolism are enriched as having differential efficacy between the two media conditions, we generated a consensus metabolic library gene list by intersecting three metabolic gene lists either generated in-house or from the literature<sup><xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup> (<xref rid="SD3" ref-type="supplementary-material">Table S3</xref>). Interestingly, we found that many compounds targeting metabolic proteins were particularly enriched for being more effective at reducing cell proliferation in RPMI (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">B</xref>). We performed a similar analysis by generating a consensus gene list comprising signaling proteins from KEGG (<xref rid="SD3" ref-type="supplementary-material">Table S3</xref>), and found that compounds targeting signaling proteins were not enriched as having differential efficacy across the two media conditions (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>).</p><p id="P14">We next performed enrichment factor analysis of significant screen hits and found that compounds targeting the metabolic enzymes NAMPT, which is involved in NAD<sup>+</sup> salvage, and DHODH, which is required for pyrimidine synthesis, were particularly effective in impairing cell proliferation in RPMI relative to ftABS (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">E</xref>). Additional compounds targeting nucleotide synthesis were also enriched as being more effective in RPMI than in ftABS (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2E</xref>). To expand this analysis to more compounds with known mechanisms of action, we also screened a small library containing FDA-approved compounds (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2F</xref>), and similarly found several compounds targeting nucleotide synthesis that displayed differential efficacy between RPMI and ftABS (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2F</xref>, <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">G</xref>). Together, these data suggest that altering environmental nutrient levels may particularly influence the response to compounds targeting cellular metabolism, but do not affect the efficacy of compounds that target cell intrinsic processes like signaling.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Screening with a metabolism-oriented library identifies many compounds with differential efficacy in ftABS compared to RPMI</title><p id="P15">To further explore whether nutrient levels affect response to compounds targeting metabolic enzymes, we next asked whether a metabolism-focused library<sup><xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup> (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>) would identify more compounds exhibiting differential efficacy between RPMI and ftABS.

FK866 is an inhibitor of NAMPT<sup><xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></sup>, an enzyme that enables salvage of NAD<sup>+</sup> from nicotinamide<sup><xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></sup>, the NAD<sup>+</sup> precursor that is abundant in RPMI (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>). We found FK866 to be highly effective in inhibiting proliferation of A549 cells cultured in RPMI, whereas cells cultured in ftABS were insensitive to FK866 treatment (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>). A549 cells were also protected from other inhibitors of NAMPT (e.g. GPP78, STF31) when cultured in ftABS (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure S3A</xref>). We reasoned that salvageable NAD<sup>+</sup> precursors other than nicotinamide may be present in biological fluids such as ftABS, but not RPMI, thus bypassing the need for NAMPT activity<sup><xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></sup>. To test this hypothesis, we measured the concentration of nicotinic acid and found it to be 1 &#x003bc;M in ftABS (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref>). Addition of nicotinic acid to this level in RPMI completely rescued the toxicity of FK866 in this medium (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D</xref>). Another salvageable NAD<sup>+</sup> precursor, nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN), also rescued FK866 toxicity but was not detected in ftABS (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figures S3B</xref>, <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">4C</xref>).</p><p id="P17">Next, we found the compound brequinar, which inhibits DHODH in the <italic toggle="yes">de novo</italic> pyrimidine synthesis pathway (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4E</xref>), to be more effective in A549 cells cultured in RPMI compared to ftABS (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4F</xref>). Uridine is readily salvaged by most cells and can bypass the requirement to synthesize pyrimidines through DHODH<sup><xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref></sup>. We detected uridine in ftABS at a level that was sufficient to rescue the toxicity of brequinar observed in cells cultured in RPMI, as addition of uridine to these levels in RPMI led to brequinar resistance (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4G</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">H</xref>, <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3C</xref>).

This was surprising, given that cells are more resistant to methotrexate when cultured in media containing the physiological folate source 5-methyl tetrahydrofolate (5-MeTHF), rather than the non-physiological folate source present in RPMI, folic acid (FA)<sup><xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>,<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref></sup>.

We next cultured A549 cells in RPMI without folates for four days to deplete their intracellular folate reserves<sup><xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref></sup>, and then titrated back either 5-MeTHF or FA to determine their effect on cell proliferation in each medium.

Yet, both standard culture media and synthetic blood-like media only capture a fraction of these metabolites and omit lipid species entirely in their base formulations. An advantage of ftABS is that this medium retains many small molecules present in serum at physiologic concentrations, including some lipids. However, the processing of ftABS to support high-throughput screening led to depletion of many lipids, since reducing protein content will remove lipoprotein and albumin, the main lipid carriers in the blood<sup><xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>,<xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref></sup>. Removal of serum proteins may also influence drug response and cell metabolism, as exemplified by a recent study in which cancer cells experiencing ferroptosis via cystine starvation can be rescued by scavenging and breakdown of supplemented protein<sup><xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref></sup>, which can serve as a nutrient source<sup><xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>,<xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref></sup>. Regardless, protein concentrations available to tumors may be lower than serum concentrations in some cases<sup><xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref></sup>, and conditions could be further optimized by adding back some components such as albumin or lipoproteins if relevant to a particular screen.</p><p id="P23">While screening in ftABS can uncover compounds whose mechanism of action depends on nutrient conditions, it may not always predict responses in animal models or patients as nutrient availability in tissues can differ from those found in the blood<sup><xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="R45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref></sup>. Regardless, the use of this screening approach to identify the relevant nutrient differences that impact response might still be informative for drug discovery. For example, many studies have proposed NAMPT as a cancer therapy based on the efficacy of NAMPT inhibitors in vitro, but efforts to target NAMPT for anticancer therapy ultimately failed in clinical trials due to lack of objective responses<sup><xref rid="R48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref></sup>, as well as dose-limiting toxicity in patients. While the activity of compounds in ftABS are unlikely to predict toxicity given inherent limitations of screening in vitro, screening in ftABS could highlight relevant modifiers of response to drugs. Indeed, determining which nutrients modify responses to a drug could be used to select contexts where responses are favored and contribute to patient selection. Additionally, identifying the relevant nutrient modifiers could suggest other dietary or pharmaceutical interventions to create metabolite conditions that may improve efficacy.</p><p id="P24">An inherent limitation of physiologic media including ftABS is that nutrient levels vary based on tissue location<sup><xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="R45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>,<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></sup>, diet<sup><xref rid="R52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>,<xref rid="R53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref></sup>, and genetics<sup><xref rid="R54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>,<xref rid="R55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref></sup>, and no singular culture medium can recapitulate the diversity of conditions cells are exposed to in vivo. A particular limitation to ftABS as a culture media is that nutrient levels will vary across lots, although quantification of metabolite levels via mass spectrometry could still enable dissection of differential phenotypes that may be observed when using a new lot of ftABS for follow up work. However, preparing enough ftABS from the same lot to complete a screening study is an important practical consideration.</p><p id="P25">In the screens reported here, the majority of compounds with differential efficacy between media conditions showed higher activity in RPMI than in ftABS.

This inherent bias in the composition of some drug libraries may skew towards hits with activity in standard culture, and screening in ftABS or other physiological media conditions could be used as a tool to flag compounds with high activity driven by artificial media conditions. Considering that many novel small-molecule compounds are identified using phenotypic-based approaches<sup><xref rid="R58" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>,<xref rid="R59" ref-type="bibr">59</xref></sup>, comparing hits in standard culture with those found in ftABS may reduce pursuit of leads whose activity is driven by unique cell culture nutrient conditions.</p><p id="P26">Of the compounds displaying greater efficacy in ftABS, the glutamine analogs azaserine and acivicin are interesting given recent findings that treating mice with A549 xenografts with azaserine impaired tumor growth<sup><xref rid="R60" ref-type="bibr">60</xref></sup>.

There is also a perception that metabolism is too flexible for targeted therapy. Yet, recent evidence suggests that cancer cells experience constrained nutrient availability in tissues, and there may be an opportunity to selectively target cancer cell metabolism based on environmental nutrient availability. Therefore, screening approaches like the one highlighted here may help understand these physiological constraints and enable more effective targeting of cancer metabolism with both new and existing drugs.</p></sec><sec id="S11"><title>CONTACT FOR REAGENT AND RESOURCE SHARING</title><p id="P28">Further information and requests for resources and reagents should be directed to and will be fulfilled by the Lead Contact, Matthew G.
