The aptamer domain is organized around a three-way junction which forms the ligand binding site. Using currently available 89 guanine aptamer sequences, a consensus secondary structure is deduced and reveals differences from the previously identified aptamer consensus. Three positions are found to display different nucleotide requirements. Using a 2-aminopurine binding assay, we show that variations are allowed depending on the aptamer context. However, changes at position 48 markedly decrease ligand binding in a context-independent fashion. This is consistent with previous observations with the adenine riboswitch in which position 48 was proposed to interact with position 74, which normally base pairs with the ligand. The <italic>in vivo</italic> transcriptional control of endogenous <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic> guanine riboswitches was studied using RT-qPCR assays. The ratio of elongated/terminated transcripts is decreased in presence of a high concentration of guanine but is dependent on the riboswitch analyzed. In general, the aptamer-2AP complex affinity correlates well with the <italic>in vivo</italic> regulation efficiency of the corresponding riboswitch. These studies suggest that core variations of guanine aptamers are used to produce a spectrum of ligand binding affinities which is used <italic>in vivo</italic> by host riboswitches to perform gene regulation.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Riboswitches are RNA molecules located in untranslated regions of several mRNAs which regulate the expression of bacterial genes involved in the biosynthesis, transport or metabolism of small molecules&#x02014;all of this without the aid of protein cofactors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>). These RNA molecules exhibit highly complex structures able to specifically bind cellular metabolites, and following a ligand-induced structural reorganization, to appropriately modulate expression of the associated gene. Riboswitches are made of two distinct domains: an aptamer domain which specifically binds a cognate ligand, and an expression platform which controls gene expression either at the transcriptional or translational level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>). Transcriptional and translational controls are respectively performed by modulation of an intrinsic terminator domain or by selective sequestration of the Shine&#x02013;Dalgarno sequence required for ribosome binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>). Moreover, it has recently been shown that riboswitches also control mRNA splicing in <italic>Neurospora crassa</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>).</p><p>Various riboswitches have been shown to specifically recognize a large variety of ligands, such as adenine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>), adenosylcobalamin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>), flavin mononucleotide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>), guanine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>), glucosamine-6-phosphate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>), glycine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>), lysine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>), intracellular magnesium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>), S-adenosyl methionine (SAM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15 B16 B17 B18">15&#x02013;18</xref>) and thiamine pyrophosphate (TPP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>). In addition, a new riboswitch tandem configuration has been shown to detect two different metabolites (SAM and TPP) suggesting that individual riboswitch elements can be assembled to make more complex regulation systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>).</p><p>The adenine and guanine riboswitches are part of purine-sensing riboswitches, which are highly conserved elements presenting several similarities in their sequence and secondary structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>). Indeed, both purine aptamers are organized around a three-way junction connecting three helices (P1, P2 and P3) where the P1 stem is the only helical region exhibiting some degree of conservation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>). A loop&#x02013;loop interaction essential for ligand binding is formed between stem-loops P2 and P3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>). Several purine riboswitch aptamer structures have been determined by X-ray crystallography and exhibit a relatively compact fold characterized by a coaxial stack formed by P1 and P3 helices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25 B26 B27">25&#x02013;27</xref>). In each case, the metabolite is bound in a cavity where it is completely surrounded by RNA contacts, supporting previous studies where a structural reorganization was found in the core region upon ligand binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>). The specificity of the ligand interaction results from the formation of a Watson&#x02013;Crick base pair with nucleotide 74 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>). Although adenine and guanine aptamers are structurally very similar, they regulate gene expression differently. Indeed, while the adenine riboswitch positively regulates gene expression upon ligand binding, the guanine riboswitch promotes premature arrest of transcription of the downstream gene in presence of guanine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>A). This marked difference is explained by the organization of the riboswitch architecture where the P1 stem is either an antiterminator or anti-antiterminator, depending if it is located in the adenine or guanine riboswitch, respectively.

Indeed, in-line probing assays in absence and presence of the corresponding ligand indicated that the structure of the aptamer undergoes dramatic changes in the core region upon addition of guanine. Considering that the original sequence alignment was performed using purine-sensing aptamer sequences and that we recently observed that ligand binding requirements of adenine aptamers are different from those of purine aptamers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>), we have established a new consensus sequence using only guanine riboswitch sequences. We find that positions 24 and 73 display specific sequence requirements and that their identity is related to the riboswitch binding affinity, which is also dependent on the aptamer context. However, a strong nucleotide requirement is observed for position 48 that is totally intolerant to the presence of guanine, which is consistent with our previous observations for the adenine riboswitch (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>). In addition, RT-qPCR analysis performed on endogenous <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic> guanine riboswitches reveals that natural riboswitch variants exhibit significant differences in their propensity to regulate gene expression. A very good correlation is obtained between the observed aptamer&#x02013;ligand affinity and the <italic>in vivo</italic> regulation efficiency of the corresponding riboswitch.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Purification of DNA oligonucleotides</title><p>Oligonucleotides were purchased from Sigma Genosys (Canada).

However, subsequent experimental validation demonstrated that three representatives are instead specific to adenine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>), thereby generating a suboptimal guanine aptamer consensus sequence. Recent work in our laboratory identified novel ligand binding requirements of the adenine riboswitch, some of which are related to the ligand binding specificity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>). Thus, we decided to analyze sequence requirements of the G box motif using only guanine-specific sequences (i.e. containing C74), with a significantly larger set of representatives from the <italic>Rfam</italic> database (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>). The complete sequence alignment performed with 89 representatives is shown on Figure S1 (Supplementary Data). We used only a subset of these sequences for the alignment shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>B. These sequences were selected because they are representatives of the natural sequence variation observed among all sequences. A consensus secondary structure shows that most nucleotides found in the core region are highly conserved as previously found (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>C) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>). In our alignment, positions 24, 48 and 73 are not as highly conserved as other positions found in the core. Indeed, position 24 conforms to the &#x02018;W&#x02019; consensus (adenine or uracil), position 48 conforms to the &#x02018;H&#x02019; consensus (every nucleotide but a guanine) and position 73 shows a degree of conservation of only 90% (compared to 95% for other core positions). To validate the consensus structure of the G box motif and to obtain a deeper understanding about the biological effects of core sequence variations found in natural variants, we analyzed the ligand binding properties of selected guanine aptamers.</p></sec><sec><title>2-aminopurine (2AP) as a fluorescent ligand for guanine riboswitches</title><p>Adenine and guanine aptamer crystal structures display a remarkable similarity about their ligand binding site but they differ in the Watson&#x02013;Crick base pair that they form with the bound ligand to achieve a high degree of specificity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>A) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>). Furthermore, the rest of the bound nucleobase makes nearly identical interactions with the aptamer suggesting that structurally similar purine-containing molecules would also make productive RNA-ligand contacts. Indeed, kinetics of ligand binding have been studied in details with the fluorescent purine analog 2AP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>). Upon formation of the 2AP:aptamer complex, 2AP fluorescence becomes significantly quenched as expected from the ligand binding pocket of purine aptamers in which the bound ligand is completely surrounded by RNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>). Moreover, we have previously shown that the G box domain exhibits &#x0223c;10-fold lower affinity toward 2AP when compared to the A box aptamer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>). However, upon introduction of a C74U mutation in the guanine aptamer, in order to convert it into an adenine-sensing aptamer, we observed that 2AP binding affinity is nearly identical to the <italic>pbuE</italic> adenine aptamer, indicating that 2AP can be used to detect affinity changes in core sequence variations. Upon visual inspection of the sequence alignment in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>B, it is immediately apparent that guanine-specific aptamers display nucleotide variations in the core domain. Given that most of these nucleotides are important for making productive interactions for ligand binding, we speculated that aptamers exhibiting core nucleotide variations might display differences in guanine binding, and that this could be reflected in their 2AP affinity. Clearly, although the 2AP binding assay does not give information about guanine binding, it nevertheless allows to directly compare the ligand binding affinities of guanine aptamers.

To validate our strategy, we employed in-line probing to investigate how similarly the aptamer domain of the guanine riboswitch recognizes 2AP. This method exploits the inherent chemical instability of RNA under physiological conditions due to the spontaneous cleavage of phosphodiester linkages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>), which is more pronounced in unstructured regions due to the fact that phosphodiester bonds are free to adopt an in-line conformation that is prevented in the context of a helix. This assay has been extensively used by others and us to monitor conformational changes induced by external ligands on numerous RNA riboswitch domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8 B9 B10 B11">8&#x02013;11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>). We therefore assessed if guanine and 2AP produced similar cleavage patterns in a guanine-sensing aptamer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>B), which should confirm a similar structure between these complexes. In absence of guanine, several cleavage products were observed that all map to formally single-stranded regions. However, a reduction of the extent of cleavage was observed in the core region in presence of guanine (positions 49&#x02013;53), indicating that the structure is reorganized upon ligand binding, as observed previously for the <italic>xpt</italic> variant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>). When in-line probing experiments were repeated with 2AP instead of guanine as a ligand, a cleavage pattern identical to that observed with guanine was obtained, showing that both purines are recognized in an apparently identical manner by the guanine riboswitch aptamer. These results show that the guanine-sensing aptamer undergoes indistinguishable structural changes in presence of either guanine or 2AP, establishing that 2AP can be used as a ligand binding reporter to study guanine-sensing riboswitches.</p><p>We performed a 2AP binding assay in which the 2AP fluorescence was monitored as a function of the <italic>xpt</italic> guanine riboswitch RNA concentration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>C). We observed that the guanine riboswitch is able to perform productive 2AP binding. Fluorescence data could be fitted to a simple two-state binding model (see Materials and Methods section), yielding an apparent dissociation constant (<italic>K</italic><sub>Dapp</sub>) value of 6.69 &#x000b1; 0.91 &#x000b5;M (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>). This value is in very good agreement with a previous in-line probing study where it was found that the 2AP binding affinity of the complex is &#x0223c;10 &#x000b5;M (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>). To ensure that the decrease in fluorescence does not result from non-specific binding, we engineered a P2 riboswitch mutant in which the formation of the essential loop&#x02013;loop interaction is not possible. We have previously shown for the adenine riboswitch that this loop&#x02013;loop interaction is essential for the formation of the aptamer&#x02013;ligand complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>). As expected, no significant fluorescence quenching was observed for this variant showing that 2AP binds in a specific manner to the aptamer and confirming that the G box riboswitch requires a functional loop&#x02013;loop interaction to perform ligand binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>C), as previously observed in the context of the isolated aptamer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Guanine aptamers exhibit a large ligand binding affinity spectrum</title><p>To estimate their relative binding affinities, we expanded our 2AP binding analysis to other guanine-sensing riboswitch aptamers (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>). We first targeted our analysis to the guanine aptamers <italic>xpt, purE, pbuG</italic> and <italic>yxjA</italic> from <italic>B. subtilis</italic>. We observed that apart from <italic>yxjA</italic>, these guanine-sensing aptamers all exhibit a relatively similar 2AP affinity with a <italic>K</italic><sub>Dapp</sub> &#x0223c;8&#x02013;10 &#x000b5;M (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>). However, the <italic>yxjA</italic> variant displays a higher 2AP affinity with an increase of 13-fold relative to <italic>xpt</italic>. The histogram representation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>D) with the apparent affinity constant used as a comparison basis shows that although <italic>B. subtilis</italic> guanine aptamers are very similar in their sequence and secondary structure, they do not all exhibit a similar ligand binding affinity. Additional guanine riboswitches were also monitored for their 2AP binding affinity. Three broad categories were found (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>D and <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>). One category has a very poor 2AP affinity (BH-<italic>ssnA</italic> and FN-<italic>purQ</italic>) while another one (BH-<italic>guaA</italic>, CA-<italic>uraA</italic>, CP-<italic>guaB</italic>, LL-<italic>xpt</italic>, LM-<italic>pbuG</italic> and OI-<italic>guaA</italic>) has an affinity similar to the <italic>xpt</italic> aptamer. The third category (STPY-<italic>xpt</italic>) exhibited very high 2AP binding affinity, similar to BS-<italic>yxjA</italic>. Taken together, our results indicate that guanine aptamers naturally exhibit variations in their ligand binding affinity that can vary over a range of at least 21-fold (compare BH-<italic>guaA</italic> and STPY-<italic>xpt</italic> aptamers). This only represents a lower limit given that the very poor 2AP affinity of BH-<italic>ssnA</italic> and FN-<italic>purQ</italic> representatives suggests an even larger ligand binding affinity spectrum.</p></sec><sec><title>Aptamers exhibiting low or high 2AP affinity are specific toward guanine</title><p>According to our 2AP binding analysis, BH-<italic>ssnA</italic> and FN-<italic>purQ</italic> exhibit undetectable 2AP binding (<italic>K</italic><sub>Dapp</sub> &#x0003e; 25 &#x000b5;M). To learn whether these variants are able to perform ligand binding, an in-line probing strategy was employed in which various ligands were tested for their ability to induce a structural change in the core domain of the aptamer. We first investigated the ligand-induced structural changes of the BH-<italic>ssnA</italic> guanine aptamer variant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>A). In absence of ligand, cleavage products were observed in the single-stranded region located between P2 and P3 stems (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>A and B). However, upon incubation with guanine, the extent of cleavage was markedly decreased suggesting that a constrained structure is adopted upon ligand binding. These results are very similar to those previously obtained for the <italic>xpt</italic> guanine aptamer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>). When the experiments were performed in presence of adenine, xanthine or hypoxanthine, no significant reduction of cleavage was observed suggesting a low binding affinity. A previous study with the BS-<italic>xpt</italic> guanine aptamer has shown that xanthine and hypoxanthine induce RNA structural changes, but to a reduced level compared to guanine (&#x0223c;10-fold) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>). Thus, our in-line probing data indicate that BH-<italic>ssnA</italic> can perform ligand binding but exhibits lower affinity toward xanthine and hypoxanthine compared to BS-<italic>xpt</italic>, which is in very good agreement with our 2AP binding studies with BS-<italic>xpt</italic> and BH-<italic>ssnA</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>D). Very similar results were obtained for the FN-<italic>purQ</italic> aptamer (data not shown).

Under conditions where a high proportion of aptamer-2AP complex is formed (see Materials and Methods section), we incubated the BS-<italic>yxjA</italic> aptamer in presence of 2AP and guanine. 2AP fluorescence monitoring showed that guanine very efficiently competes with 2AP but adenine, xanthine and hypoxanthine do not, indicating that they exhibit a poorer ability to displace 2AP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>C). Thus, our results show that the BS-<italic>yxjA</italic> aptamer has a higher affinity toward guanine than adenine, xanthine and hypoxanthine, which is consistent with previous findings for other guanine-specific riboswitches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>). The STPY-<italic>xpt</italic> variant, also analyzed using this assay, gave very similar results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>C), indicating that both the BS-<italic>yxjA</italic> and the STPY-<italic>xpt</italic> aptamers are guanine-specific, and that they both exhibit &#x0223c;15-fold higher ligand affinity compared to the BS-<italic>xpt</italic> variant.</p></sec><sec><title>2AP and guanine exhibit proportional affinities toward guanine aptamers</title><p>Although 2AP and guanine are recognized similarly by the aptamer domain of the guanine riboswitch (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>B), 2AP affinity variations observed in this work may not be representatives of affinity variations exhibited toward the natural ligand, guanine. To explore this possibility, a subset of aptamers showing substantial heterogeneity in 2AP affinity was selected and characterized using the in-line probing assay (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>). This assay may be used to determine ligand dissociation constants by performing the experiments in presence of various concentrations of ligand and by monitoring the variations in spontaneous scission products. Using this procedure, we established an apparent dissociation constant for guanine (<italic>K</italic><sub>Dapp G</sub>) of 4.7 &#x000b1; 3.6 nM for the BS-<italic>xpt</italic> guanine aptamer (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>). This is in excellent agreement with the value &#x0223c;5 nM obtained by Breaker and coworkers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>). Next, we characterized the aptamers BH-<italic>ssnA</italic>, CP-<italic>guaB</italic> and BS-<italic>yxjA</italic> which show various affinities for 2AP (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>).

To study the nucleotide requirement at position 48, a guanine was introduced at position 48 in three natural guanine aptamers showing nucleotide variations at this position.

However, introduction of G48 in the BS-<italic>xpt</italic> aptamer (U48G variant) altered the local structure of the core domain where enhanced cleavages were observed for positions 47 and 49, while a reduced scission was observed for position 48 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>D).

To our knowledge, this is the first direct demonstration that guanine riboswitches modulate gene expression by controlling premature transcription termination, which is in very good agreement with previously reported &#x003b2;-galactosidase gene expression studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>), and consequently provides further strong evidence in favor of the originally proposed riboswitch regulation mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>).</p><p>The endogenous <italic>purE</italic> riboswitch was also monitored <italic>in vivo</italic> under various guanine concentrations using RT-qPCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>B). In presence of 0.25 mg/ml guanine, a small but significant termination efficiency (&#x0223c;20%) was detected, which was further increased to &#x0223c;80% by incubating at a saturating guanine concentration, indicating that the <italic>purE</italic> variant is more efficient than <italic>xpt</italic> to promote transcription termination <italic>in vivo</italic>. Strikingly, an even higher guanine-dependent transcription termination efficiency was observed when monitoring the <italic>yxjA</italic> riboswitch variant, which yielded &#x0223c;55 and &#x0223c;98% termination efficiencies at 0.25 mg/ml and saturating guanine concentrations, respectively. These results clearly indicate that <italic>B. subtilis</italic> guanine riboswitches do not all perform gene regulation with similar efficiencies, which most probably reflects individual regulation requirements of each regulon. Interestingly, the <italic>yxjA</italic> variant exhibits the highest ligand binding affinity (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>) as well as the most efficient riboswitch activity studied in this work (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>B). Although these results strongly suggest that ligand binding is very important for the riboswitch-mediated gene expression control, alternative factors are likely to play important role(s) in the regulation given that both <italic>xpt</italic> and <italic>purE</italic> exhibit similar ligand binding affinities (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>), yet they clearly show differences for modulating gene expression levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>B).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>Here, we study the ligand binding requirements of guanine-sensing riboswitches to establish what are the molecular determinants involved in the formation of the ligand&#x02013;aptamer complex, and to understand how they are used in the ligand binding process. In contrast to the original study in which the G box motif was described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>), the refined G box consensus proposed here is strictly based on 89 guanine-specific aptamers from which several structural characteristics are revealed (Figure S1). For example, compared to other paired regions, the P2 stem shows a slightly higher mismatch rate, suggesting that mutations in this region are more easily accommodated in the tertiary fold. The P1 stem varies from two to nine base pairs throughout the entire sequence alignment suggesting that corresponding expression platforms are very likely to differ concomitantly to properly regulate premature transcription attenuation. Sequences involved in the loop&#x02013;loop interaction are also conserved for positions known to be involved in platform tetrads (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>). The core region of the consensus secondary structure is very conserved, with the exception of positions 24, 48 and 73. From the entire sequence alignment (Figure S1, Supplementary Data), no single base identity co-variation can be established between 24, 48 and 73, nor with other nucleotides, which is most probably because none of these three positions is involved in critical interactions, as observed in crystal structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>). A24 is located between G72 and A73 and has been proposed to act as a spacer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>), position 48 is completely exposed to the solvent, and A73 forms a water-mediated triple with the U22-A52 Watson&#x02013;Crick base pair. Since nucleotides 24, 48 and 73 are situated relatively in close proximity to the bound ligand, their spatial organization is expected to be dependent upon ligand binding. Indeed, recent fluorescence studies have shown that a 2AP nucleobase introduced at either position 24 or 48 exhibits fluorescence emission changes upon ligand binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>), in agreement with in-line probing results showing that most of the core region is reorganized upon ligand binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>). Thus, although nucleotides 24, 48 and 73 do not perform direct interactions with conserved nucleotides in the folded state, they are very likely important for the ligand-induced structural reorganization of guanine riboswitches.</p><p>2AP is traditionally used as a substitute for adenine, but because 2AP is a purine nucleobase that produces an in-line probing pattern indistinguishable to that obtained in presence of guanine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>B), it can also be used as a ligand to study guanine riboswitches. 2AP fluorescence quenching experiments show that the complete riboswitch sequence can efficiently perform ligand binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>C), which is in contrast to what we observed in the context of the <italic>pbuE</italic> adenine riboswitch (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>), suggesting that both riboswitch regulation mechanisms could operate under different control regimes to achieve gene expression regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>). By examining a large array of naturally occurring guanine aptamers, our 2AP data show that an intrinsic large spectrum of ligand affinities is present among them (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>D), which is also observed when using guanine-induced in-line probing assays (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>). Interestingly, as previously determined by Breaker and co-workers in the context of BS-<italic>xpt</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>), a systematic variation of &#x0223c;10<sup>3</sup>-fold is observed between 2AP and guanine binding affinities (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>) indicating that although 2AP shows weaker affinity compared to guanine, it can nevertheless reliably provide relative ligand binding affinities of guanine aptamers. The sequence alignment in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>B is arranged to represent 2AP binding affinity variations observed among naturally occurring guanine aptamers. Upon examination of the alignment, the two aptamers showing highest binding affinities (STPY-<italic>xpt</italic> and BS-<italic>yxjA</italic>) are characterized by the presence of a uracil at position 24 together with a stable P2 helical domain beginning with a G-C or G-U base pair. In addition, a proportional correlation is observed between the stability of the P2 stem and the ligand binding affinity. However, aptamers exhibiting weakest binding activities (position-<italic>ssnA</italic> and FN-<italic>purQ</italic>) possess an extra nucleotide immediately upstream of the position 73 which could inhibit the insertion of the base 24 between positions 72 and 73. This variation is not present in any other naturally occurring variant (Figure S1, Supplementary Data) suggesting that this insertion is not widespread among riboswitches. Binding activity also appears to be inversely proportional to the stability of the P3 helical domain, which is not always the case since low binding affinity aptamers (BH-<italic>ssnA</italic> and FN-<italic>purQ</italic>) do not exhibit a stable P3 stem. Taken together, the large affinity binding spectrum suggests that guanine riboswitches do not all respond to similar intracellular guanine concentrations or that various cellular conditions (e.g. ionic strength) may be important for their gene regulation activity. For instance, the <italic>xpt</italic> operon is found in three different organisms (<italic>B. subtilis, Lactococcus lactis</italic> and <italic>Streptococcus pyogenes</italic>) and exhibits a variation of &#x0223c;14-fold for the formation of the aptamer-2AP complex (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>). However, this is not always the case since significant differences are found even within the same organism (i.e. <italic>B. subtilis</italic>). Therefore, these variations are most likely important to allow the differential control for various bacterial regulons.</p><p>Site-directed mutagenesis analysis shows that positions 24 and 73 display sequence requirements that are highly dependent on the aptamer variant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>A and C). For instance, introduction of either A24U or A73G is highly detrimental for the ligand binding activity of the BS-<italic>xpt</italic> aptamer. However, given that BS-<italic>yxjA</italic> and LM-<italic>pbuG</italic> contain U24 and G73, respectively, it strongly suggests that the nucleotide identity is highly dependent on the sequence context. Moreover, when comparing BS-<italic>yxjA</italic> and LM-<italic>pbuG</italic> to BS-<italic>xpt</italic>, it can be observed that they are divergent mostly in their P2 and P3 stem regions where base insertions and deletions occur (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>B). Since it has been shown that loop&#x02013;loop formation and ligand binding are related events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>), it is likely that the structural arrangement of stem-loops P2 and P3 is important for core folding, in which nucleotides 24 and 73 are located. However, this trend is not generalized to the entire sequence alignment (Figure S1, Supplementary Data), suggesting that other structural compensation(s) may be present in other aptamer variants. In addition, the originally proposed non-conserved position 48 displays a remarkable intolerance to guanine at this position given that its introduction in three different aptamers systematically perturbs ligand binding to a high extent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>B). This suggests that, in contrast to the other two core positions examined in this study, the negative effect of G48 is dominant over the sequence context (i.e. context-independent). Interestingly, the complete sequence alignment (Figure S1, Supplementary Data) shows that there is no natural aptamer sequence harboring G48. These results are in very good agreement with our previous study where we have shown that, in an U74C purine aptamer mutant, the presence of G48 is highly deleterious for ligand binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>). This was attributed to a putative tertiary interaction occurring between positions 48 and 74 that is taking place in absence of ligand which reduces the propensity of the aptamer to perform efficient ligand binding. However, in contrast to what was observed for the U74C aptamer, the BS-<italic>xpt</italic> G48-containing guanine aptamer is still competent to perform guanine binding albeit to a reduced level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>D).</p><p>Of all <italic>B. subtilis</italic> guanine aptamers, the <italic>yxjA</italic> variant exhibits the highest ligand binding affinity (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>), and interestingly, is the one showing the most efficient riboswitch activity <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>B). Compared to <italic>xpt</italic> and <italic>purE</italic> variants, the <italic>yxjA</italic> riboswitch exhibits higher activity in guanine concentrations ranging from sub-saturating to saturating levels. Thus, because <italic>yxjA</italic> is the most active riboswitch in saturating conditions, where the riboswitch aptamer is fully bound to the ligand and where premature transcription termination is expected to be primarily dependent on the terminator strength, it suggests that the <italic>yxjA</italic> terminator is more stable than those of <italic>xpt</italic> and <italic>purE</italic>. As expected, when analyzing the predicted relative free energy of each terminator (&#x00394;<italic>G</italic><sup>Term</sup>), it can be observed that <italic>yxjA</italic> exhibits the most stable structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>C), and accordingly, the <italic>purE</italic> variant shows a more stable terminator domain compared to <italic>xpt</italic>, which is in agreement with their respective premature termination efficiencies obtained at saturating guanine concentrations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>B). In addition, when analyzing RT-qPCR data obtained at 0.25 mg/ml where saturation is not yet attained and where ligand binding affinity should be important for gene regulation, it can be observed that only <italic>purE</italic> and <italic>yxjA</italic> show premature termination, <italic>yxjA</italic> still exhibiting the highest efficiency, which is in agreement with its high ligand binding affinity (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>). Although the ligand binding affinity is likely to be important for the propensity of the riboswitch to perform gene regulation, subtle differences are present that cannot readily be accounted for. For instance, even though the termination efficiency of <italic>purE</italic> is higher than <italic>xpt</italic> at a sub-saturating guanine concentration (0.25 mg/ml), both aptamers exhibit similar ligand binding affinity (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>). However, because the ON state <italic>xpt</italic> antiterminator structure is predicted to be more stable (&#x00394;<italic>G</italic><sup>Anti</sup>) than that of <italic>purE</italic>, it is possible that the <italic>xpt</italic> antiterminator might inhibit to a higher degree the formation of the <italic>xpt</italic> aptamer domain when compared to the <italic>purE</italic> variant. This would consequently decrease the propensity of the <italic>xpt</italic> riboswitch to perform ligand binding, consistent with our RT-qPCR data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>B).</p><p>Interestingly, of all <italic>B. subtilis</italic> guanine riboswitch-regulated transcripts, <italic>yxjA</italic> is the only one not controlled by the PurR repressor, which regulates transcription initiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>). Thus, it is conceivable that because it does not rely on a transcription initiation regulation mechanism, <italic>yxjA</italic> might exhibit higher activities for both ligand binding as well as premature transcription termination to ensure proper gene expression regulation. Whether this fully explains the very efficient riboswitch activity of <italic>yxjA</italic> will remain to be established but, nevertheless, our study shows that guanine riboswitches exhibit variations in their ligand binding affinities between bacterial hosts and genetic units.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>SUPPLEMENTARY DATA</title><p>Supplementary Data are available at NAR Online.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS</title><p>We thank members of the Lafontaine laboratory for helpful discussions, and Drs Carlos Penedo, Sherif Abou Elela, Sirinart Ananvoranich and Alain Lavigueur for critical reading of the manuscript.
