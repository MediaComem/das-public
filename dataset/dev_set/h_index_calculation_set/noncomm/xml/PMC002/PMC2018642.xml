We have studied the translation of interferon regulatory factor 2 (IRF2) mRNA, a negative regulator of transcription of interferon-stimulated genes and demonstrated the presence of internal ribosome entry site (IRES) element in the 5<bold>&#x02032;</bold>UTR of IRF2 RNA. Various control experiments ruled out the contribution of leaky scanning, cryptic promoter activity or RNA splicing in the internal initiation of IRF2 RNA. It seems IRF2-IRES function is not sensitive to eIF4G cleavage, since its activity was only marginally affected in presence of Coxsackievirus 2A protease. Interferon &#x003b1; treatment did not affect the IRF2-IRES activity or the protein level significantly. Also, in cells treated with tunicamycin [an agent causing endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress], the IRF2-IRES activity and the protein levels were unaffected, although the cap-dependent translation was severely impaired. Analysis of the cellular protein binding with the IRF2-IRES suggests certain cellular factors, which might influence its function under stress conditions. Interestingly, partial knockdown of PTB protein significantly inhibited the IRF2-IRES function. Taken together, it appears that IRF2 gene expression during stress condition is controlled by the IRES element, which in turn influences the cellular response.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Interferon regulatory factors (IRFs) are DNA-binding proteins that control interferon (IFN) gene expression. IRF1 has been shown to function as an activator of IFN and IFN-inducible genes, whereas IRF2 represses the action of IRF1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>). Since, interferon induction is followed by translational attenuation; it is plausible that the synthesis of IRF2 protein, which is required to repress and regulate the IFN stimulated genes, is allowed to continue under such condition using an alternate mechanism of translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>). In fact, the repressor of IFN-&#x003b2; promoter, NRF (NF-&#x003ba;B repressing factor) protein has been shown to be translationally regulated to provide sufficient level of NRF protein for the complete silencing of the IFN-&#x003b2; genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>).

Although the general mode of translation of cellular mRNAs involves cap-dependent translation initiation, a sizeable proportion of mRNAs was shown to be associated with polyribosomes in poliovirus-infected cells at a time when cap-dependent initiation is impaired (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>). The most widespread mechanism of cap-independent mode of translation initiation is mediated by internal ribosome entry sites (IRESs), which directly recruits ribosome bypassing the requirement for 5&#x02032; cap structure and the cap-binding protein eIF4E (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>). Many mRNAs that contain IRESs encode proteins that play important roles in cell growth, proliferation, differentiation and regulation of apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7 B8 B9 B10">7&#x02013;10</xref>). Stress conditions, such as starvation of growth factors, heat shock, hypoxia and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress leads to down regulation of protein synthesis through phosphorylation of eIF2&#x003b1; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>). However, a number of cellular mRNAs containing IRES elements such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>), <italic>c-Myc</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>), cat-1 mRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>), NRF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>) and PITSLRE kinase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>) continue to be translated under conditions when cap-dependent translation is severely impaired. Similarly, inhibition of protein synthesis during apoptosis is accompanied by a caspase-dependent cleavage of initiation factor eIF4G (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>). However, there is strong evidence that translation of death associated protein (DAP5) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>), X-chromosome linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein (XIAP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>), apoptotic protease activating factor (Apaf1) mRNAs is maintained under these conditions and is driven by their respective IRES elements. This indicates that these mRNAs containing IRES may probably have a reduced requirement for the intact eIF4G, allowing the translation of mRNAs containing them to continue under stress conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>). This mode of initiation of translation probably protects cells from hostile conditions or at least help them to tide over transient stress conditions.</p><p>Here, we have investigated the presence of IRES element in the 5&#x02032; untranslated region (UTR) of &#x02018;interferon regulatory factor 2&#x02032; or IRF2, which belongs to interferon regulatory factor family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>). Our results suggest that IRF2 5&#x02032; UTR (177 nt) contains an IRES element, which undergoes translation initiation in an eIF4G-independent manner. Also, it seems that IFN-&#x003b1; treatment does not inhibit the IRF2-IRES function to the extent observed in case of HCV or BiP IRES activity (GRP78). Analysis of the cellular protein binding with the IRF2-IRES showed specific binding of certain cellular factors, which might influence its function under stress conditions. In fact PTB protein has been shown to specifically interact with the IRF2 5&#x02032;UTR and partial knock down of PTB protein resulted in significant decrease in IRF2-IRES activity. Additionally, we have studied the effect of ER stress on IRF2-IRES function. In cells treated with tunicamycin, the IRF2 protein level as well as the IRES function was found to be largely unaltered. These results suggest that the IRES element of the IRF2 mRNA allow translation initiation under stress condition and may play a role in the cellular response.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Plasmid constructs</title><p>The cDNA corresponding to the 5&#x02032; UTR of IRF2, was amplified from the RNA isolated from HeLa cells and cloned in pCDNA 3.1 (+). The primers were used according to the GenBank sequence NM_002199 and confirmed by DNA sequencing (Gene Bank Acc. No. for IRF2 5&#x02032;UTR, DQ409328). The construct pR&#x00394;ENullF was a kind gift from Dr Peter Sarnow (Stanford University). All the bicistronic constructs contain respective 5&#x02032;UTR sequences (pRIRF2F, pRHAVF and pRBipF) cloned between Renilla luciferase (RLuc) and firefly luciferase (FLuc) genes, in pCDNA 3.1 in between HindIII and EcoRI sites. The eukaryotic promoter less bicistronic construct, the pGEMT-R-IRF-F, containing the IRF2 5&#x02032;UTR and also the pR&#x00394;EnullF bicistronic cassette were cloned in pGEMT easy vector (Promega) under T7 promoter. The T7pRCVB3F was cloned in the pBluescript vector (Stratagene) under T7 promoter. The landscape of structure derived from inactive &#x00394;EMCV IRES sequence was cloned upstream of Rluc gene in the upstream hairpin (uphp) bicistronic plasmid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>). The Nsp bicistronic construct (pRNspF) contains 264 nt from La ORF (120&#x02013;204 amino acid encoding region) between Rluc and Fluc (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>). For constructing IRF2 monocistronic plasmid (pIRF2Fluc), IRF2-Fluc was digested with HindIII and ApaI enzymes (NEB) from the plasmid pRIRF2F and ligated in HindIII, ApaI digested pCDNA 3.1-Fluc. Coxsackievirus 2A protease gene was amplified from CVB3 cDNA (a generous gift from Nora Chapman, Nebraska) using the primers with BamH1 and EcoR1 sites respectively and cloned in pCDN3.1 His C (pCD2A<sup>pro</sup>). The primers used are as follows: Cox(F):5&#x02032;ATTAggATCCggCgCATTTggACAA3&#x02032;; Cox(R):5&#x02032;ACgCgAATTCCTgTTCCATTgCATC 3&#x02032;. Bicistronic plasmids pRHAVF and pRBipF were constructed as described earlier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>). The primers used for the amplification of IRF2 5&#x02032;UTR are as follows: IRF2(F)-5&#x02032;CggCAAgCTTTCTCCTTgTTTTgCT3&#x02032;;IRF2(R)- 5&#x02032;ATATgAATTCggTgCCCTCTCAgTg3&#x02032;.</p></sec><sec><title>Cell lines and transfection</title><p>Hela S3, Huh7 cells were maintained in DMEM (Invitrogen) with 10% fetal bovine serum (GIBCO, Invitrogen). Cells were transfected with various bicistronic plasmids and pSV40&#x000df;-gal using Tfx 20 reagent (Promega) and luciferase assay was performed using Dual luciferase assay reagent (Promega). In experiments using eukaryotic promoter-less bicistronic constructs, cells were infected with vaccinia virus expressing T7 RNA polymerase, VTF7.3 (generous gift from Dr B. Moss, NIH) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>) prior to transfection with bicistronic plasmids. Luciferase assay was performed by dual luciferase assay reporter reagent (Promega) in a TD 20/20 luminometer (Turner Design, CA, USA). For the interferon experiment, Huh 7 cells was transfected with the bicistronic plasmids pRIRF2F, pRHCVF, pRBiPF followed by treatment of 1000 IU/ml of IFN&#x02013;alpha 2b (Virchow Ltd). For the 2A protease experiment, co-transfection was performed using pRCVB3F, pRIRF2F and pRHAVF bicistronic plasmids with Coxsackie 2A<sup>pro</sup> plasmid (pCD2Apro) constructs. Luciferase assay was performed after 24 h of transfection. For tunicamycin treatment, cells were incubated in presence of 2.5&#x003bc;g/ml of tunicamycin (Calbiochem) for 14 h. Co-transfection of siRNA with bicistronic plasmid was performed in HeLa S3 cells growing in monolayer using lipofectamine-2000 transfection reagent and optiMEM-I prepared without addition of antibiotic (Invitrogen). Cells were seeded onto 35 mm dishes one day prior to transfection in similar manner. For each transfection, 100 nM of pre-characterized siPTB (Dharmacon) and 1 &#x003bc;g of bicistronic DNA were diluted with optiMEM-I to a final volume of 100 &#x003bc;l. In a separate tube, 6 &#x003bc;l of lipofectamine-2000 was diluted with 94 &#x003bc;l of optiMEM-I to a final volume of 100 &#x003bc;l followed by incubation at room temperature for 5 min. The contents of the two tubes were mixed and incubated at room temperature for 20 min. Subsequently, 800 &#x003bc;l of optiMEM-I was added to the transfection mixture, which was then layered onto cells. Six hours later, the medium was replaced with 2 ml of DMEM (with antibiotic) and 10% FBS. Thirty-six hours post&#x02013;transfection, the cells were washed, lysed with passive lysis buffer and luciferase enzymes assayed in a similar way. For RNA transfections, capped bicistronic RNAs were synthesized <italic>in vitro</italic> from different constructs <italic>(</italic>RIRF2F, RBipF, R&#x00394;EnullF) using T7RNA polymerase (Ribomax kit, Promega). Ten microgram of the above synthesized RNAs were used to transfect HeLa cells using Lipofectamine 2000 and optiMEM-I (Invitrogen) as described above. After 6 h, medium was replaced with 2 ml of DMEM (with antibiotic) and luciferase assay was performed by dual luciferase assay reporter reagent (Promega) after 8 h incubation. Enzyme activity was measured in a TD 20/20 luminometer (Turner Design, CA, USA). The transfection efficiency was normalized and the relative luciferase activities were plotted.</p></sec><sec><title><italic>In vitro</italic> transcription</title><p>To make antisense FLuc probe RNA, pCD Luc DNA was linearized with HindIII (NEB) and transcribed by SP6 RNA polymerase (Promega) and 10 &#x003bc;Ci/&#x003bc;l of alpha <sup>32</sup>P UTP (NEN) as per manufacturer's guidelines. The HCV 5&#x02032;UTR RNA probe was made from HCV-GFP DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>) linearized with EcoRI and was transcribed by T7 RNA polymerase. Similarly, the <sup>32</sup>P-labeled RNA probes corresponding to the 5&#x02032;UTRs of IRF2 and HAV were made from their respective plasmid DNAs after linearizing with either NcoI or EcoRI and transcribed with either Sp6 or T7 RNA polymerase, respectively. The non-specific RNA was made from linearized pGEMT as described elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>). pRIRF2F, pRBipF, pR&#x00394;EnullF bicistronic plasmids were linearized with Pme1 (NEB) and the corresponding bicistronic RNAs were synthesized using Ribomax kit (Promega) following manufacturer's protocol.</p></sec><sec><title>Northern blotting and RT-PCR</title><p>Total RNA from the HeLa cells, transfected with pRIRF2F, pRCVB3F bicistronic plasmids were extracted using TRIZOL (Sigma), followed by DNase I treatment.

For this purpose, IRF2 5&#x02032; UTR was amplified by RT-PCR from total RNA isolated from HeLa cells. The nucleotide sequence of the IRF2 5&#x02032;UTR has been shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>A. Zuker's MFOLD algorithm predicted a stable secondary structure with a minimal free energy of &#x02212;41.7 kcal/mol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>B) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>). Similar secondary structure was predicted by MFOLD for the BiP IRES (data not shown). It would be interesting to investigate whether IRF2 5&#x02032;UTR contains the &#x02018;Y&#x02019;-type stem-loop structure that has been suggested as the characteristic feature of certain cellular IRESs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>).</p><p>To investigate the presence of IRES element in the 5&#x02032;UTR of IRF2, the amplified IRF2 5&#x02032; UTR was subsequently cloned in a bicistronic construct in between two reporter genes. The upstream reporter (Renilla luciferase) in this bicistronic RNA is translated by cap-dependent mode, whereas the downstream reporter (Firefly luciferase) will be translated if the intergenic region contained a functional IRES element. The bicistronic plasmid, pRIRF2F was transiently transfected into HeLa cells followed by luciferase assay. The results showed appreciable amount of firefly luciferase (Fluc) translation mediated by the IRF2 5&#x02032;UTR. The Fluc activity was found to be around 12.5-fold higher compared to the negative control bicistronic plasmid, pR&#x00394;EnullF. Interestingly, the bicistronic plasmid pRBipF, containing Bip IRES as positive control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>), showed &#x0223c;17-fold increase in the Fluc activity compared to null bicistronic plasmid control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>D and E). However, cap-dependent translation of the renilla luciferase (RLuc) was found to be similar in all the three plasmids as expected. These results indicate that the 5&#x02032;UTR of IRF2 might contain an IRES element, the activity of which is comparable to that of representative cellular IRES.</p></sec><sec><title>The cap-independent translation of IRF2 is not due to scanning or ribosomal read-through</title><p>In order to rule out scanning or ribosomal read-through as the possible reason for the IRF2 5&#x02032;UTR-mediated translation of the firefly luciferase, we have used IRF2 bicistronic construct p&#x00394;ERIRF2F, containing region of highly stable secondary structure upstream of renilla luciferase to prevent ribosome loading (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>F) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>). When the p&#x00394;ERIRF2F plasmid was transfected into HeLa cells, RLuc activity was found to be significantly inhibited. However, no significant change in Fluc translation was observed compared to values obtained with the control IRF2 bicistronic construct pRIRF2F (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>G). Similarly, when the plasmid pR&#x00394;EIRF2F containing the internal hairpin structure inserted downstream of Rluc (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>G) was trasnsfected into HeLa cells, FLuc activity was not inhibited. Interestingly, FLuc activity was found to be marginally higher compared to control, probably due to a change in IRF2-IRES RNA structure in the context of the internal hairpin. However, Rluc activity remained unchanged as expected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>G). The results suggest that the translation of the downstream cistron Fluc was not due to ribosomal read-through of the first cistron.</p></sec><sec><title>IRF2 5&#x02032;UTR does not have cryptic promoter or splice sites</title><p>It is possible that in the cells transfected with IRF2 bicistronic plasmid, small amount of monocistronic FLuc RNA is generated from the bicistronic construct due to cryptic promoter activity of the IRF2 5&#x02032;UTR sequence. In order to rule out this possibility, HeLa cells were transfected with IRF2 bicistronic construct that was cloned in a vector, which lacked conventional eukaryotic promoter but contained a T7 phage promoter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>A). Similarly, null and coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3) bicistronic plasmids were used respectively as negative and positive controls in the experiment. Results showed luciferase activity almost equal to background level in absence of any eukaryotic promoter in the transfected constructs. But when cells were transfected with recombinant vaccinia virus expressing T7 RNA polymerase gene (VTF7.3) prior to transfection of the construct, significant levels of Fluc and Rluc activity were detected from the same IRF2 and CVB3 bicistronic constructs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>A). In fact Fluc activity mediated by IRF2-IRES was found to be around 15 times that of the null construct. As expected, the viral IRES (CVB3) showed much higher efficiency compared to cellular IRES activity under this condition.

This activation also results in increased transcription of these regulatory factors. Thus the effect of global attenuation of translation might not affect their protein level as much. However, it is important to modulate the activity of these IRFs as well to maintain the intricate balance and the cellular response. IRF2 protein has been shown to negatively regulate the interferon pathway. We hypothesize, that continuous synthesis of IRF2 protein by its IRES element probably ensures unaltered protein level under this situation, which in turn might regulate IFN-induced gene expression. In fact western blot analysis did show similar levels of IRF2 protein in control and interferon-treated cells in support of our hypothesis.</p><p>In this study, we have shown evidence for a cap-independent translation initiation or IRES-mediated translation of IRF2 that probably allows a response to various stress conditions. Bicistronic assays were employed to show that the IRF2 5&#x02032;UTR is capable of mediating internal initiation. Furthermore, using stringent assays we have tried to rule out cryptic promoter or splicing activity. Although, our northern blot and RT-PCR analysis clearly showed intact bicistronic RNAs in transfected cells, it is difficult to absolutely rule out the presence of lower abundance of mono-cistronic RNAs generated due to RNA degradation or spurious splicing activity in the context of RLuc/FLuc bicistronic construct as shown in XIAP IRES (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>).</p><p>In general, IFN causes activation of PKR, which leads to the phosphorylation of eIF2-alpha culminating in the suppression of protein synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>). Our study shows that in the presence of interferon, when majority of protein synthesis is affected, IRF2 is still synthesized by IRES mode of translation. However, this is not true for all cellular IRES, since BiP IRES activity showed significant inhibition. Also HCV IRES was found to be sensitive to interferon treatment as reported earlier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>).

The observation put forward the idea that IRF2 protein might be involved in the cellular responses in other stress conditions as well.</p><p>Several cellular IRESs have been shown to be active under conditions when eIF4G is cleaved. Incidentally, it has been shown that p50 (a central one-third part of eIF4G) and p100 (C terminal two-third fragment of eIF4G) can partially replace the function of the intact eIF4G in translation initiation mediated by the EMCV IRES (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>). In fact, the cleavage product of eIF4G as well as the eIF4G-related protein p97 and its cleavage product p86 has been shown to influence the IRES function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>). Interestingly, IRF2 5&#x02032;UTR showed binding with polypeptides of &#x0223c;50 and 100 kDa when 2A protease-treated cell extract was used. Also in our assay, p86 was found to bind with IRF2 but not with HAV IRES. It appears that the binding of these polypeptides could give selective advantage to the IRF2-IRES activity over HAV IRES under conditions of eIF4G cleavage.</p><p>PTB protein has been implicated to modulate functions of several cellular mRNAs. It has been shown to act as RNA chaperone and facilitate Apaf1-IRES structure and influence the efficiency of its translation initiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>). It has also been reported to positively regulate the IRES-mediated translation of HIF-1&#x003b1;, p27kip1, etc (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>), whereas it negatively regulates unr and BiP IRES function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>). Our results suggest that PTB protein might be required for the efficient activity of the IRF2-IRES, since partial knockdown significantly affected the IRES activity. Interestingly, the cytoplasmic pool of PTB protein has been shown to vary under various physiological stress conditions, such as apoptosis and viral infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>). Since it appears that the IRF2-IRES remains active under stress conditions and may be regulatable, it would be interesting to investigate how the abundance of PTB protein during such conditions could influence the IRES function. Currently, experiments are in progress to verify the MFOLD predicted secondary structure of the IRF2-IRES and how PTB binding can influence IRF2-IRES function during physiological stress conditions.</p><p>Although, IRF2 protein is known as a negative regulator of interferon-stimulated genes, it has been implicated to stimulate vascular cell adhesion molecule (VCAM) and regulation of histone H4 genes under various conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>). The fact that the IRF2 gene is translationally regulated under stress conditions (such as ER stress and interferon treatment), it might have indirect effect on other gene expression as well. Thus, it is likely that the regulated expression of IRF2 protein under various stress conditions would have major implications on the cellular response. Incidentally, this study constitutes the first report on translational control of interferon regulatory factors by internal initiation. The results might have far reaching implications on the possible role of IRF2 in controlling the intricate balance of cellular gene expression under stress conditions in general.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS</title><p>We thank Dr Peter Sarnow (Stanford), Dr Akio Nomoto (Tokyo), Dr Nora Chapman (Nebraska), Dr J.G.
