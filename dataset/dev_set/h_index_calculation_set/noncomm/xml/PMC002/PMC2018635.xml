Pol &#x003b2; expression has been previously shown to be regulated at the level of transcription, but there is also evidence of post-transcriptional regulation, since rat transcripts undergo alternative polyadenylation, and the resulting 3&#x02032;UTR contain at least one regulatory element. Data presented here indicate that RNA of the short 3&#x02032;UTR folds to form a strong secondary structure (hairpin). Its regulatory role was established utilizing a luciferase-based reporter system. Further studies led to the identification of a protein factor, which binds to this element&#x02014;the anti-apoptotic, cytoskeleton-related protein Hax-1. The results of <italic>in vitro</italic> binding analysis indicate that the formation of the RNA&#x02013;protein complex is significantly impaired by disruption of the hairpin motif. We demonstrate that Hax-1 binds to Pol &#x003b2; mRNA exclusively in the form of a dimer. Biochemical analysis revealed the presence of Hax-1 in mitochondria, but also in the nuclear matrix, which, along with its transcript-binding properties, suggests that Hax-1 plays a role in post-transcriptional regulation of expression of Pol &#x003b2;.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>In eukaryotic cells, DNA polymerase &#x003b2; (Pol &#x003b2;) is essential for base excision repair (BER) and involved in recombination and drug resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>). Pol &#x003b2; expression levels are important for the maintenance of genome integrity. On account of its low fidelity, the overexpression of Pol &#x003b2;, which has been reported in several cancer types, leads to a mutator phenotype associated with genetic instability and decreased sensitivity to anti-cancer chemotherapeutics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3 B4 B5 B6">3&#x02013;6</xref>). Conversely, cells deficient in DNA polymerase &#x003b2; display hypersensitvity to alkylating agent-induced apoptosis and chromosomal breakage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>). Sugo <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>) have demonstrated that Pol &#x003b2;-deficient mice die immediately after birth, due to extensive apoptosis in the developing central and peripheral nervous systems. These data indicate that DNA polymerase &#x003b2; expression level is extremely important and must be tightly regulated.</p><p>Transcription of the Pol &#x003b2; gene is upregulated by the phosphorylated transcription factor CREB-1 in response to alkylating agent exposure. This upregulation requires the presence of the specific cAMP response element (CRE) in the promoter of the Pol &#x003b2; gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>). It has also been shown that the Pol &#x003b2; promoter contains a binding site for the transcription factor SP1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>). Although regulation at the transcription level is apparent, expression of the Pol &#x003b2; transcripts might also be controlled at the post-transcriptional level. In rat cells there are two alternatively polyadenylated Pol &#x003b2; transcripts, with 3&#x02032;UTRs of significantly different lengths (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>). The expression of the two transcripts is tissue specific. The short transcript is present in most tissues, with significantly higher expression in testis, while the long transcript is expressed mostly in the brain and lungs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>). Motifs present in the 3&#x02032;UTRs of the two transcripts are likely to be responsible for regulation of tissue-specific expression.</p><p>Sequence of the short 3&#x02032;UTR is highly similar in the rat and human genes (up to 90% of homology in the conserved region), but in the further region of the long 3&#x02032;UTR similarity abruptly decreases, which is consistent with the observation that there is only one (short) Pol &#x003b2; transcript in the human cells. Sequence similarity indicates that regulatory motifs present in the short 3&#x02032;UTR of the rat Pol &#x003b2; transcript may act in the same manner and bind similar factors in human cells.</p><p>Structure prediction analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>) of the short 3&#x02032;UTR revealed the presence of a putative hairpin element, &#x0223c;50 nt upstream of the polyadenylation sequence and 40&#x02013;50 nt downstream of the termination codon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>). There are several examples of transcripts with similar structures within the 3&#x02032;UTR, constituting <italic>cis</italic>-acting regulatory elements, involved in mRNA localization. Structural motifs (hairpins) present within the 3&#x02032;UTR of c-fos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>), c-myc (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>), MT-1 [metallothionein-1, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>)], slow troponin C (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>) and vimentin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>) mRNAs have been shown to be involved in targeting these mRNAs to the perinuclear cytoplasm and, presumably, anchoring them in this location by binding to cytoskeletal elements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>). Hairpin elements within the 3&#x02032;UTRs were also reported to stabilize transcripts by binding factors that protect against nuclease cleavage [e.g. binding of IRP protein to the IRE sequence in the 3&#x02032;UTR of transferrin receptor mRNA, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>)] and to re-program translation as in the case of the SECIS element which directs an insertion of selenocysteine into in-frame UGA codons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>).</p><p>In this report, we confirm the existence of the hairpin structure within the 3&#x02032;UTR of the Pol &#x003b2; mRNA and demonstrate that this element influences the expression of a reporter gene. We describe the identification of a protein factor binding to this motif&#x02014;Hax-1, an anti-apoptotic, cytoskeleton-related protein, which is known to bind a hairpin structure within the 3&#x02032;UTR of vimentin mRNA. We demonstrate that binding occurs only for a Hax-1 dimer, though RNA binding is not a prerequisite for the dimerization itself. We confirm the importance of the hairpin structure for binding of Hax-1 by its mutagenic disruption, which impairs the RNA&#x02013;protein interaction. We also report strong association of Hax-1 with the nuclear matrix, which is a novel finding, consistent with its transcript-binding properties. Taken together, these data suggest that the hairpin element within the Pol &#x003b2; 3&#x02032;UTR represents a novel motif important for post-transcriptional regulation of expression.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Structural analysis of RNA</title><p>The template for <italic>in vitro</italic> transcription encompassing the whole short 3&#x02032;UTR of rat Pol&#x003b2; (208 nt) was synthesized by PCR with a forward primer containing the T7 RNA polymerase promoter sequence (5&#x02032;-TAATACGACTCACTATAGGGCCTGCCCCACCCAGGCCT) and reverse primer (5&#x02032;-AAACCATGGTACTGCGATC).

For this purpose, we used limited fragmentation of the 5&#x02032;-end-labeled RNA with six well-characterized biochemical structural probes: lead ions and five enzymes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>A). Nuclease S1 and lead ions have no documented nucleotide specificity, while ribonuclease T2 and A recognize all nucleotides but have a higher activity for adenosines and pyrimidines, respectively. RNase T1 exhibits specificity exclusively for guanosines and RNase Cl3 digests C-residues only. All the above structural probes recognize flexible and single-stranded regions in the RNA structure. Prior to the probing experiments, the 5&#x02032;-end labeled transcript of the Pol &#x003b2; short 3&#x02032;UTR was analyzed by non-denaturing gel electrophoresis. The result of this test suggests that only a single conformer is formed by the analyzed RNA molecule (migrated as a single band on a gel, not shown).

Module M1 represents a small hairpin structure with a C-rich terminal loop. The 3&#x02032;-part of this structure is efficiently hydrolyzed with lead ions, even at a low concentration of the probe, which suggests that M1 hairpin has binding capacity for this metal ion. Module M3 contains the polyadenylation signal, followed by the cleavage and polyadenylation site, so only a part of it is present in the mature short Pol &#x003b2; transcript, which implies minor importance of the whole M3 module as a post-transcriptional regulatory element. Module M2 is formed by nucleotides located between bases G29 and C96 of the analyzed transcript and is composed of three helical regions, two 6 bp and one 14 bp in length. Each of these helical regions is resistant to enzymatic digestion and lead ion hydrolysis. The three helixes are separated by two asymmetric, internal loops (b and c), which are mapped very well by all probes used. The longest helical region includes as many as six non-WC, U-G and G-U base pairs. Four of these exist as two tandems: U-G, G-U and U-G, U-G, which are known to be potential metal- or protein-binding sites. The hairpin structure contains a small 3-nt terminal loop (5&#x02032;-UAU), which is also well recognized by both lead ions and enzymes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>A and B). The M2 hairpin structure is conserved among species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>), which suggests its significant role in regulation of transcript fate.

The rat hepatoma cell line FTO-2B was transfected with reporter constructs bearing the Firefly luciferase gene appended by the Pol &#x003b2; 3&#x02032;UTR sequence containing the M2 hairpin element, (pCMLucH) and by the same sequence containing a structure-disrupting mutation in the hairpin-forming region (pCMLucHmut). A vector bearing the unmodified luciferase gene served as a control (pCMLuc). To asses mRNA levels of the reporter, quantitative PCR was performed for cDNA preparations obtained from cells subjected to the same transfections as for luciferase assays. The results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>) show a significant decrease of mRNA levels for the construct with the hairpin structure (H), compared with almost unchanged mRNA levels for the mutated hairpin (Hmut). These differences, however, are not reflected at the protein level: both constructs (H and Hmut) caused an increase in luciferase expression, although only for the Hmut is this increase significant. The relative increase of protein levels in respect to mRNA levels is therefore more than 3-fold for the construct with the intact hairpin, while only a slight relative increase (&#x0223c;1.7-fold) was observed for the mutated construct. These changes in expression indicate a complex post-transcriptional regulation in which the hairpin element has a key function.

In the present work, secondary structure analysis by lead ion hydrolysis and enzymatic digestion revealed the existence of several motifs in the analyzed sequence, namely, a region of strong lead ion binding (M1), a hairpin-forming and highly evolutionarily conserved region (designated as M2) and the region containing polyadenylation sequence (M3). Only M2 is evolutionary conserved, the rest of the untranslated region has high interspecies sequence variation, which suggests lesser functional importance. The sequence in the conserved region exhibits 86.8% identity to the homologous human sequence (100% in the upper stem region), which may indicate a similar role of this element in human cells.</p><p>We show here that the hairpin structure within the 3&#x02032;UTR influences the expression of a luciferase reporter gene. Lowering of luciferase mRNA levels for the construct with an intact hairpin structure in contrast with almost unchanged mRNA levels for the mutated structure indicate that the hairpin is in fact an RNA destabilizing element. However, at the protein level, expression for both constructs exceeds the expression of the control. This indicates the presence of at least two regulatory events in which the hairpin structure is involved: (i) mRNA degradation, (ii) enhanced mRNA transport (possibly coupled with mRNA stabilization) and/or enhanced translation. These effects may be the consequence of the competitive binding of <italic>trans</italic>-acting factors for the binding site within the hairpin. Thus, identification of the hairpin-binding factors is important for assessment of its physiological role.</p><p>A yeast three-hybrid screen identified Hax-1 as the binding partner for the hairpin structure of the Pol &#x003b2; 3&#x02032;UTR. Hax-1 is an RNA-binding protein, known as an anti-apoptotic factor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>) associated with cytoskeletal proteins and involved in cell migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>).</p><p>Hitherto only one RNA target of Hax-1 has been identified: vimentin mRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>). Data from several reports suggest that Hax-1 binding to the hairpin element within the 3&#x02032;UTR of the vimentin transcript plays a role in its localization to the perinuclear cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>). The importance of proper vimentin transcript localization is illustrated by the fact that its misdirection alters cell morphology and motility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>). The identification of a second RNA target of Hax-1&#x02014;the hairpin element present in the Pol &#x003b2; transcript&#x02014;raises the question as to the identity of other mRNA targets of the protein. One may speculate that there is a pool of such mRNAs, especially because vimentin and Pol &#x003b2; are not functionally or evolutionarily related nor are they involved in the same pathway.</p><p>Comparison of the hairpin motifs in vimentin and Pol &#x003b2; mRNAs did not reveal any significant similarities, which could suggest substrate requirements for Hax-1 binding. The presence of U-rich single-stranded regions (vimentin: AGUUUU in the terminal loop, Pol &#x003b2;: AGUUAU in the internal loop) represents the only similarity between the two structures, but the helical regions adjacent to this U-rich sequence in the Pol &#x003b2; mRNA are not evolutionarily conserved. The lack of similarities suggests that Hax-1-binding mechanism and affinities might be different for these two structures.</p><p>It is an open question if Hax-1 is in fact a destabilizing factor or if its actions in respect to the Pol &#x003b2; transcript consist of mRNA stabilization, possibly coupled with its transport and/or localized translation. The fact that Hax-1 binds to the instability element (the hairpin) and does not bind to the stable mutated transcript suggests a role in mRNA destabilization. However, data concerning the role of Hax-1 in the regulation of vimentin transcript, indicating that it facilitates its transport to the perinuclear space, are rather contradictory to its potential functions in mRNA degradation. Another possible explanation is that Hax-1 may stabilize otherwise unstable mRNAs and facilitate their transport or enhance the translation rate, conferring elevated luciferase levels in respect to mRNA levels.</p><p>If this latter case is true, considering that Hax-1 has been identified as the same <italic>trans</italic>-acting factor for both vimentin and Pol &#x003b2; mRNAs, the hairpin element within the 3&#x02032;UTR of the Pol &#x003b2; transcript may also represent a motif directing mRNA to the perinuclear space. Perinuclear localization of certain transcripts, and their subsequent translation at this site, could facilitate an efficient nuclear import of newly synthesized proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>). DNA polymerase &#x003b2; as a nuclear protein could also benefit from such a mechanism.</p><p>To present a satisfactory explanation of the role of Hax-1 transcript binding in the cell, one has to resolve the question of the subcellular location of Hax-1. Hitherto, Hax-1 has been reported to localize predominantly in the mitochondria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>) but it has also been detected in the endoplasmic reticulum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>), apical membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>), lammelipodia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>) and nuclear envelope (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>). In the last case, the presence of Hax-1 in the nuclear envelope was interpreted as a consequence of its association with intracellular membranes (by its putative transmembrane domain), as a continuum of endoplasmic reticulum localization. Our data reveal for the first time, that Hax-1 is associated with the nuclear matrix, which is coherent with its transcript-binding capacity and supports the notion of its role in post-transcriptional regulation.</p><p>Some new data support Hax-1 association with the nucleus. In a recent report, Kawaguchi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>) shows that Hax-1 is present in the nucleus of systemic sclerosis fibroblasts (but not in normal fibroblasts) and is involved in pre-IL-1&#x003b1; translocation into the nucleus&#x02014;a process blocked by inhibition of Hax-1. This activity is contradictory to previously reported Hax-1 involvement in the cytoplasmic retention of IL-1&#x003b1; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>) and EBNA-LP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>). The role of Hax-1 in protein import into the nucleus might suggest that it is shuttling between the nuclear matrix and perinuclear space, transporting different cargo molecules.</p><p>Participation of the hairpin element in the binding between the Pol &#x003b2; 3&#x02032;UTR and Hax-1 was demonstrated by UV-cross-linking, in which the transcript with an intact hairpin structure bound to the protein, whereas a transcript with a disrupted hairpin did not. Cross-linking also revealed that Hax-1 binds to mRNA only in the form of a dimer. The presence of a band of a molecular weight of 100 kDa indicates that UV exposure cross-linked a complex consisting of RNA bound to a protein dimer. RNA&#x02013;monomer complexes were not detected. Data from chemical cross-linking lead us to conclude that the RNA molecule is not necessary for dimerization. However, given that only a small percentage of protein dimerizes <italic>in vitro</italic> in the absence of mRNA, the possibility that RNA binding influences the dimerization rate is tempting, and remains to be assessed.</p><p>Filter-binding experiments, complementing the cross-links, showed that the binding, though not completely abolished, is substantially weakened for a mutated sequence with a disrupted hairpin structure.</p><p>Only the C-terminal part of Hax-1 appears to be involved in mRNA binding, since a truncated peptide bearing only the last 150 aa of the protein suffices for binding the hairpin-containing element, as demonstrated in our experiments utilizing the yeast three-hybrid system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>). Considering that an interaction with RNA occurs only for dimeric Hax-1, these findings suggest that the domain responsible for the dimerization is also located in the C-terminal part of the protein. From these results, we deduce that BH domains (BH1 and BH2) present in the N-terminal part of the protein do not take part in the dimerization. BH domains and a transmembrane domain (present at the C-terminus of Hax-1) represent the features of Bcl-2 family proteins, but there is no significant sequence homology between these proteins and Hax-1 - only a weak, partial homology to pro-apoptotic Nip3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>). Even though BH domains are known to be important for oligomerization of the proteins from the Bcl-2 family, data seem to exclude the possibility that they are responsible for dimerization of Hax-1.</p><p>We have demonstrated that the hairpin structure within the 3&#x02032;UTR of the Pol &#x003b2; mRNA represents a post-transcriptional regulatory element. Hax-1 protein, which binds to this element, appears to be an important <italic>trans</italic>-acting factor, though the exact mechanism of Hax-1-mediated regulation remains to be elucidated, and the mechanisms implicating its role in control of mRNA stability, transport and/or localized translation must be verified by subsequent experiments. Hax-1 is a multifunctional protein, active in different cellular compartments and involved in various cellular processes. Attention has been focused on its functions in apoptosis and regulation of cell motility, but it seems that it has a more complex mode of action and plays a regulatory role in the context of its specific mRNA targets.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS</title><p>We thank Antek &#x00141;&#x00105;czkowski for assistance and helpful discussions concerning nonlinear regression analysis, Csaba Koncz, Zsuzsanna Koncz and Sabine Schaefer for providing pET201 and supporting discussions, Dominique Weil for providing pCMLuc, Ronald Berezney for providing the anti-matrin 3 antibody and Renata Zub for technical assistance.
