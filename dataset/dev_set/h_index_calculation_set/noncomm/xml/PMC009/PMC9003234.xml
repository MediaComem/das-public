have emerged to mitigate <italic>Plasmodium</italic> drug resistance,
which has hampered the fight against malaria. M5717
is a potent multistage antiplasmodial drug under clinical development,
which inhibits parasite protein synthesis. The combination of M5717
with pyronaridine, an inhibitor of hemozoin formation, displays potent
activity against blood stage <italic>Plasmodium</italic> infection.
However, the impact of this therapy on liver infection by <italic>Plasmodium</italic> remains unknown. Here, we employed a recently
described 3D culture-based hepatic infection platform to evaluate
the activity of the M5717-pyronaridine combination against hepatic
infection by <italic>P. berghei</italic>. This effect was further
confirmed <italic>in vivo</italic> by employing the C57BL/6J rodent <italic>Plasmodium</italic> infection model. Collectively, our data demonstrate
that pyronaridine potentiates the activity of M5717 against <italic>P. berghei</italic> hepatic development. These preclinical results
contribute to the validation of pyronaridine as a suitable partner
drug for M5717, supporting the clinical evaluation of this novel antiplasmodial
combination therapy.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>pyronaridine</kwd><kwd>M5717</kwd><kwd>combination therapy</kwd><kwd>liver stage infection</kwd><kwd>malaria</kwd><kwd>drug discovery</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Merck KGaA</institution><institution-id institution-id-type="doi">10.13039/100009945</institution-id></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>10.13039/100009945</award-id></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Funda&#x000c3;&#x000a7;&#x000c3;&#x000a3;o para a Ci&#x000c3;&#x000aa;ncia e a Tecnologia</institution><institution-id institution-id-type="doi">10.13039/501100001871</institution-id></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>PD/BD/128371/2017</award-id></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Funda&#x000c3;&#x000a7;&#x000c3;&#x000a3;o para a Ci&#x000c3;&#x000aa;ncia e a Tecnologia</institution><institution-id institution-id-type="doi">10.13039/501100001871</institution-id></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CRCNA/BRB/0281/2019</award-id></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Funda&#x000c3;&#x000a7;&#x000c3;&#x000a3;o para a Ci&#x000c3;&#x000aa;ncia e a Tecnologia</institution><institution-id institution-id-type="doi">10.13039/501100001871</institution-id></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CEECIND/03539/2017</award-id></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>document-id-old-9</meta-name><meta-value>id1c00640</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>document-id-new-14</meta-name><meta-value>id1c00640</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>ccc-price</meta-name><meta-value/></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><p id="sec1">In 2020 alone,
malaria was responsible
for more than 600&#x0202f;000 deaths worldwide, resulting from over
200 million infections by <italic>Plasmodium</italic> parasites, the
causative agents of disease. The burden of malaria is mostly felt
in the African region and primarily affects children under the age
of 5.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref></sup></p><p><italic>Plasmodium</italic> parasites, of which <italic>P. falciparum</italic> is the deadliest
to humans, cycle between a mammalian host and an
insect vector. An obligatory and clinically silent pre-erythrocytic
stage of <italic>Plasmodium</italic> infection takes place in the
host&#x02019;s liver cells,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref></sup> where the parasite develops
within a parasitophorous vacuole, giving rise to thousands of red
blood cell-infectious merozoites,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref></sup> leading to
the erythrocytic stage of infection. The latter is responsible for
the clinical manifestations of malaria<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref></sup> and for the transmission to the mosquito vector upon ingestion of
gametocytes during a blood meal.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref></sup></p><p>Most pharmacological approaches against malaria focus on the clinically
relevant erythrocytic stage of infection. However, the obligatorily
nature of the pre-erythrocytic stage of the parasite&#x02019;s life
cycle provides an appealing opportunity for prophylaxis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref></sup> Only few drugs target the hepatic stage of infection,
a scarcity that can be explained by the constraints in experimental
access to sporozoites and the lack of drug screening models that faithfully
recapitulate the liver microenvironment. We have recently established
a 3D infection platform, employing spheroids of human hepatic cell
lines that maintain a stable hepatic phenotype over the course of
4 weeks and enable the evaluation of drugs against hepatic infection
by the rodent <italic>P. berghei</italic> parasite, in either static
or dynamic culture conditions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref></sup></p><p>M5717,
or DDD107498, a drug candidate under clinical development,
was shown to inhibit protein synthesis by targeting <italic>P. falciparum</italic>&#x02019;s translation elongation factor 2 (eEF2).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref></sup> In preclinical studies, M5717 displayed nanomolar-ranged
activity across the life cycle of <italic>Plasmodium</italic> parasites,
including blocking of transmission. The pre-erythrocytic activity
of M5717 against <italic>P. yoelii</italic> and <italic>P. berghei</italic> infection was also demonstrated <italic>in vitro</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref></sup> Employing our <italic>in vitro</italic> platform, we estimated a
10 nM minimum inhibitory concentration of M5717, when administered
during the hepatic development of <italic>Plasmodium</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref></sup> This observation correlated with the plasma concentration
that cleared liver-stage <italic>P. berghei</italic> infection <italic>in vivo</italic> when M5717 was administered as a radical cure<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref></sup> or as a prophylactic treatment, prior to infection.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref></sup> M5717&#x02019;s novel mechanism of action, potent
multistage antiplasmodial activity, and long plasma half-life make
it a promising candidate for the treatment and prevention of malaria.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref></sup> Since generation of resistance to M5717 was identified
in preclinical studies,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref></sup> suitable partner
drugs have been sought. Pyronaridine (Pyro), a hemozoin formation
inhibitor,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>&#x02212;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref></sup> was identified as a suitable combination partner
for M5717 in a mouse model of human malaria.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref></sup> No detrimental pharmacodynamic interactions were observed between
the two drugs, and M5717 did not impact the killing rate of Pyro.
Moreover, the latter cleared M5717-related resistance and delayed
parasite recrudescence.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref></sup> The effectiveness
of the combination of M5717 and Pyro against pre-erythrocytic stage
parasites remains unknown.</p><p>In this work, we assessed the impact
of M5717 combination with
Pyro on the pre-erythrocytic stage of the malaria parasite&#x02019;s
life cycle, employing preclinical models of <italic>P. berghei</italic> infection. We show that Pyro is not detrimental to the pre-erythrocytic
activity of M5717, rather potentiating its activity against <italic>P. berghei</italic> hepatic infection <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>. Altogether, our results support the selection of

Pharmacokinetic analysis of the blood of the treated

that the plasma concentrations of Pyro in monotherapy and in combination

tested against the asexual erythrocytic stage of the <italic>Plasmodium</italic> life cycle.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref></sup> Importantly, <italic>in
vitro</italic> isobologram studies and <italic>in vivo</italic> testing
revealed a non detrimental interaction between both drugs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref></sup></p><p>Besides its efficacy against asexual blood-stage <italic>Plasmodium</italic> parasites, M5717 is also active against exoerythrocytic
parasite
forms. Thus, it was important to ensure that its combination with
Pyro would not hamper these relevant prophylactic and transmission-blocking
activities. Our <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> observations demonstrate that the combination of M5717 with Pyro
does not impair its pre-erythrocytic activity. Interestingly, our
results point to a potentiation of this activity, both <italic>in
vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>. As an inhibitor of hemozoin
formation, Pyro is not expected to possess liver stage activity. This
has been formally demonstrated in an <italic>in vitro</italic> model
of <italic>P. yoelii</italic> infection of mouse primary hepatocytes,
where infected cells were exposed to Pyro throughout the 48 h of hepatic
infection.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref></sup> At nanomolar-range doses (100,
10, and 1 nM), Pyro did not display activity against the parasite&#x02019;s
hepatic stages. At higher doses, which included the 1 &#x003bc;M dose
employed in this study, Pyro was hepatotoxic, which did not allow
the assessment of its impact on the infection rate.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref></sup> In our <italic>in vitro</italic> 3D model, 1 &#x003bc;M Pyro
did not show hepatotoxicity, as confirmed by different analytical
methods (<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acsinfecdis.1c00640/suppl_file/id1c00640_si_001.pdf">Figure S3</ext-link>). Rather, the viability
of cell spheroids that were exposed to the M5717-Pyro combination
was comparable to that of spheroids that were exposed solely to M5717.
The absence of pre-erythrocytic activity of Pyro was further supported
by our <italic>in vivo</italic> observations, which show that the
administration of this drug to <italic>Pb</italic>-Luc-infected mice
has no impact on the ongoing liver infection. Thus, the enhanced pre-erythrocytic
activity of the combination is not justified by the addition of the
activities of the individual drugs. This type of interaction is not
unprecedented, as chloroquine, an antiplasmodial drug structurally
and target related to Pyro, has been described to potentiate primaquine&#x02019;s
activity against the pre-erythrocytic stage of infection, even though
chloroquine has no inhibitory activity of its own.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref></sup> This effect was shown to be specific to this combination,
as it was not observed when chloroquine was combined with atovaquone.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref></sup> Interestingly, this potentiation effect was
only noted in primary hepatocytes but not in HepG2-A16 cells, which
have reduced cytochrome P450 activities.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref></sup> The fact that we observed a potentiation of M5717&#x02019;s activity <italic>in vitro</italic> using the HepG2 cell line may be related to the
enhanced physiological relevance of the 3D hepatic system employed.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref>&#x02212;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref></sup> Similar to the enhancement of primaquine&#x02019;s activity by chloroquine,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref></sup> the identification of the molecular mechanism
underlying the potentiation of M5717&#x02019;s activity by Pyro described
in this study requires further experimental work.</p><p>An assessment
of the effect of a drug combination against the pre-erythrocytic
stage of <italic>Plasmodium</italic> infection was first carried out
in 2016 for Malarone.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref></sup> This combination
of atovaquone and proguanil, employed both for the chemoprevention
and the treatment of malaria, was already known to display a synergistic
effect against the erythrocytic stage of infection<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref></sup> and was next demonstrated to also be synergistic against
developing hepatic <italic>P. yoelii</italic> parasites, providing
a pharmacological basis for its success in chemoprevention.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref></sup> Although this study highlighted the importance
of widening the evaluation of antiplasmodial drug combinations against
the pre-erythrocytic stage of the parasite&#x02019;s life cycle, the
literature on this subject remains rather limited. Other drug combinations
have since been evaluated in the pre-erythrocytic context, such as
the combination of several antiretroviral drugs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref></sup> or of metformin with primaquine<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">22</xref></sup> against rodent <italic>Plasmodium</italic> infection, and of ivermectin
and chloroquine against <italic>P. cynomolgi</italic> in rhesus macaques.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">23</xref></sup> Our study now adds to the scarce information
available on the pre-erythrocytic activity of antiplasmodial drug
combinations and further validates the physiologically relevant 3D <italic>in vitro</italic> hepatic platform to provide data that correlates
with the outcome of drug evaluation <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p><p>This study identifies Pyro not only as a suitable partner drug
for M5717 but also as an enhancer of this drug&#x02019;s activity against
the pre-erythrocytic stage of <italic>Plasmodium</italic> infection.
Our results demonstrate the added value of this drug combination for
malaria chemoprevention, informing the clinical development of this
compound and paving the way for its deployment in the field.</p></sec><sec id="sec3"><title>Methods</title><sec id="sec3.1"><title>Ethics
