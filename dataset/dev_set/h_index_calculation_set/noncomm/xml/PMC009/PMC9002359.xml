The analyses showed no significant difference in soundscape appropriateness for relaxation depending on the heating, ventilation and cooling system typologies, and in soundscape appropriateness for working from home (WFH) based on the ventilation strategy. Higher soundscape appropriateness for WFH was associated with houses equipped only with radiant floors for heating in Italy and with air-cooling systems in London. In London, air systems resulted in higher perceived dominance of noise from building services compared to other systems. Overall, rooms with less dominant sounds from building services were evaluated as more appropriate for working and relaxing. The dominance of sky or buildings from the window view, outdoor noisiness, noise sensitivity, age and gender were not significantly associated with participants&#x02019; window opening behaviour while WFH. Differently, participants viewing more vegetation from windows in Italy were more likely (odds ratio: 1.279) to keep the window open while WFH.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Acoustic comfort</kwd><kwd>building service</kwd><kwd>COVID-19</kwd><kwd>indoor soundscape</kwd><kwd>window opening</kwd><kwd>working from home</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group specific-use="FundRef"><award-group id="award1-01436244211054443"><funding-source id="funding1-01436244211054443">

The evaluation of the indoor acoustic environment during relaxation was in general not significantly different depending on the type of building services present at home. With reference to home working, no difference was detected between different types of ventilation strategies. As regards heating systems, a higher appropriateness for WFH was found in Italy in houses equipped with only radiant floors compared to those with only stoves or only electric heaters. This might be due to the fact that radiant floors provide a low-noise solution for heating, that might be particularly beneficial for home working. Moreover, the presence of radiant floors could be a proxy for newly built or retrofitted houses that may be able to provide better overall acoustic conditions compared to older houses, which are more likely equipped with stoves or electric heaters. As regards the cooling strategies, the presence of air-cooling systems (e.g. air conditioners) was associated with more appropriate spaces for WFH in both London and Italy, in the latter case as a tendence. However, as the survey has been administered in the heating season (i.e. with cooling systems off), differences might be attributable to the fact that houses equipped with air-cooling systems are more likely newly built or retrofitted.<fig position="float" fig-type="figure" id="fig6-01436244211054443"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><p>Graphical representation of the main results on the effects building service typologies on indoor soundscapes while working from home (WFH) and relaxing.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_01436244211054443-fig6" position="float"/></fig></p><p>In most cases building services were not dominant sources inside dwellings. A higher percentage of participants reported that sound from building services was dominant in Italy compared to London, both with reference to WFH and relaxation. This might be due to the fact that sounds from building services are more likely masked in London by outdoor sources than, on average, in Italy. In London, air systems for heating, cooling and ventilation resulted in higher perceived dominance compared to other systems (cf. <xref rid="fig5-01436244211054443" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>).

Notably, building occupants viewing more vegetation from windows in Italy were more likely to keep the window open while WFH. Differently, the dominance of buildings or sky in the window view, the sensitivity to noise, age and gender were not significantly associated with the window opening behaviour while WFH neither in London nor in Italy. As regards the impact of the outdoor acoustic environment, only a (non-significant) trend could be observed: people reporting that their room overlooked a noisy area tended to be between 22 and 30% less likely to keep the window open while WFH, respectively for London and Italy. This is consistent with the results from an extended analysis on the London dataset,<sup><xref rid="bibr38-01436244211054443" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>,<xref rid="bibr43-01436244211054443" ref-type="bibr">43</xref></sup> that showed that rooms exposed to noisy urban areas were associated with indoor soundscapes perceived as more annoying and less appropriate for WFH and relaxation. In few cases, participants spontaneously reported the need to close windows while WFH because of noise.<sup><xref rid="bibr38-01436244211054443" ref-type="bibr">38</xref></sup> The data showed that, among those using natural or mixed-mode ventilation, 67% of participants in London (N <sub>London</sub>: 311) and 60% of the participants in Italy (N <sub>Italy</sub>: 231) keep the window open at least sometimes while WFH. By selecting those who work in environments overlooking noisy urban areas (N <sub>London</sub>: 205, N <sub>Italy</sub>: 157), those opening the window at least sometimes are still the 65.5% and the 56.7% of those living respectively in London and in Italy. Despite working in rooms that are exposed to noisy urban contexts is not ideal, people tend to keep windows open, even in winter. Previous literature<sup><xref rid="bibr31-01436244211054443" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></sup> identified a number of factors driving the interaction with window, mainly related to indoor and outdoor thermal states, outdoor and indoor air quality, visual conditions, contextual factors (e.g. time of the day, season) and personal factors (e.g. thermal sensation, preferences). In an office space in Washington,<sup><xref rid="bibr44-01436244211054443" ref-type="bibr">44</xref></sup> it was found that in winter windows were opened mostly to cool down the room and/or to improve air circulation, while in summer and fall occupants opened the windows to cool the room, add some background noise and circulating air.</p><p>The present study suggests that even in presence of noisy contexts there might be other benefits linked to the availability of an open window that can compensate for higher noise levels.

One of the shortcomings is related to the cross-sectional nature of the study, which does not allow to establish any causal relationship on the observed associations. As a further point, the study focused on the impact of the sound environment on daytime activities. Due to the potential impacts on sleep quality, findings cannot therefore be extended to the night time period, but they can help to maximise the potential of NV during the day, possibly combined with MV at night and at certain times of the year (i.e. mixed-mode ventilation). Although much work has been caried out on the effects of noise on sleep,<sup><xref rid="bibr54-01436244211054443" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="bibr56-01436244211054443" ref-type="bibr">56</xref></sup> further and dedicated research would be needed to explore soundscape influence on sleep quality. The research relied on self-reporting questionnaires, that might be affected by respondents misunderstanding or not correctly estimating and reporting the aspects under investigation. Due to the adoption of an online survey and to the pandemic situation, no in situ acoustic measurements could be done at this stage. Moreover, the lack of reference data in the pre-pandemic period, did not allow to determine the impacts, if any, in the observed results that are due to the altered psychological status of participants during the lockdown period. However, the study helped to highlight associations to be further analysed and reviewed in future longitudinal studies.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec17-01436244211054443"><title>Conclusions</title><p>The study reported the results from an online survey administered to people living and working from home in London and Italy during the COVID-19 lockdown. The analyses have provided some preliminary findings on (1) the impacts of the type of buildings services on the perception of the acoustic environment while working and relaxing at home and on (2) the factors associated with window opening behaviour. Main findings are:<list list-type="simple" id="list2-01436244211054443"><list-item><p>&#x02022; No significant difference was found in soundscape appropriateness for relaxation depending on the heating, ventilation and cooling system typologies, and in soundscape appropriateness for working from home (WFH) based on the ventilation strategy. Higher soundscape appropriateness for WFH was associated with houses equipped only with radiant floors for heating in Italy compared to those with only stoves or only electric heaters and with air-cooling systems in London compared to those without any cooling system. In most cases, building services were not dominant sources inside dwellings, especially in London. Higher perceived dominance was only related in London to air systems for heating, cooling and ventilation, compared to other systems. In general, spaces with less dominant sounds from building services were evaluated as more appropriate for working and relaxing at home, both in London and in Italy.</p></list-item><list-item><p>&#x02022; As regards window opening behaviour, the dominance of sky or other buildings from the window view, noise sensitivity, the availability of a quiet side, age and gender were not significantly associated with participants&#x02019; window opening behaviour while WFH. Differently, participants viewing more vegetation from windows in Italy were more likely (Odds Ratio: 1.279, 95% confidence interval: 1.055&#x02013;1.550) to keep the window open while WFH. Among those using natural or mixed-mode ventilation and exposed to noisy urban areas, still the majority of participants in London (65.5%) and in Italy (56.7%) kept the window open at least sometimes to always while WFH, suggesting the existence of benefits from natural ventilation (NV) in winter able to compensate for higher noise levels.</p></list-item></list></p><p>Overall, the results offer some initial hints on the importance of the &#x02018;perceived&#x02019; acoustic dominance of sound by building services for indoor soundscape assessment. Most of the differences in soundscape evaluation have been observed with reference to home working and not to relaxation, thus suggesting a different sensitivity to noise from building services across the two domestic uses and the need to reconsider the acoustic requirements in residential buildings in light of the new tasks performed at home in the post-pandemic era, as in the case of home working.</p><p>Findings on window opening behaviour are relevant for those modelling occupant behaviours in energy simulation programmes. The survey has been conducted in winter and the results cannot be generalized to other seasons, given the seasonal effects on window opening behaviour reported in the literature.<sup><xref rid="bibr57-01436244211054443" ref-type="bibr">57</xref></sup> Future longitudinal studies coupled with in situ monitoring campaigns are needed to further verify the associations highlighted in the present study and to link &#x02018;perceived&#x02019; sound dominance with objectively measurable metrics. Moreover, by focussing on major Italian cities (e.g. Rome, Milan), it will be possible to test climate and cultural effects across the two countries. Lastly, future research would be useful to explore the multiple benefits associated with natural ventilation, thus providing evidence on the potential &#x02018;adaptive acoustic comfort&#x02019; opportunities provided by NV buildings.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="COI-statement"><p><bold>Declaration of conflicting interests:</bold> The author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect to the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.</p></fn><fn fn-type="financial-disclosure"><p><bold>Funding:</bold> The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This work was funded by the Chartered Institution of Building Services Engineers (CIBSE) within the project &#x02018;Home as a place of rest and work: the ideal indoor soundscape during the COVID-19 pandemic and beyond&#x02019;.
