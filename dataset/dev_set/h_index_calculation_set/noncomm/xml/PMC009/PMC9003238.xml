pandemic has underlined the need for a more
coordinated and forward-looking investment in the search for new medicines
targeting emerging health care threats. Repositioning currently approved
drugs is a popular approach to any new emerging disease, but it represents
a first wave of response. Behind this would be a second wave of more
specifically designed therapies based on activities against specific
molecular targets or in phenotypic assays. Following the successful
deployment and uptake of previous open access compound collections,
we assembled the Pandemic Response Box, a collection of 400 compounds
to facilitate drug discovery in emerging infectious disease. These
are based on public domain information on chemotypes currently in
discovery and early development which have been shown to have useful
activities and were prioritized by medicinal chemistry experts. They
are freely available to the community as a pharmacological test set
with the understanding that data will be shared rapidly in the public
domain.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Pandemics</kwd><kwd>screening</kwd><kwd>drug discovery</kwd><kwd>antivirals</kwd><kwd>antibacterials</kwd><kwd>antifungals</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation</institution><institution-id institution-id-type="doi">10.13039/100000865</institution-id></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>19-BMGF-006</award-id></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation</institution><institution-id institution-id-type="doi">10.13039/100000865</institution-id></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>OPP1082091</award-id></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>document-id-old-9</meta-name><meta-value>id1c00527</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>document-id-new-14</meta-name><meta-value>id1c00527</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>ccc-price</meta-name><meta-value/></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><p id="sec1">Finding new
agents to combat
emerging pandemic diseases requires preparation and foresight. The
initial response to a new pathogen is to reposition existing anti-infective
agents or other supportive therapies. The primary drivers for this
approach are clinical safety&#x02014;ensuring that the drug causes
no additional harm and efficacy; the arena for testing is the clinic.
It is estimated that around 40% of medicines approved for treatment
of tropical diseases have been identified through repurposing. The
best known are albendazole for echinococcosis and neurocysticercosis,
and azithromycin for trachoma.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref></sup> The key
driver here is often the off-label use of well-known anti-infective
drugs in compassionate use programs clinically. The FDA has set up
the Collaborative Use Repurposing Engine (CURE) to capture and centralize
the global experience of new uses of approved medical products to
treat emerging threats, NTDs (neglected tropical diseases), and infections
with multidrug-resistant organisms, with a Web site <uri xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="http://cure.ncats.io">cure.ncats.io</uri> that allows health
care providers to report their experiences of both successful and
unsuccessful treatments. The other approach is to use cellular anti-infective
assays to screen compound collections for potential new treatments.
An initial submicromolar response triggers initial interest. On the
basis of known or modeled tissue concentrations in humans, an analysis
can be made as to whether such concentrations can be achieved safely
in the clinic. As has been seen from the recent flood of molecules
for treating Covid-19 patients, although many candidates are suggested,
few make it past the first hurdle of being predicted to be able to
safely achieve an effective tissue exposure in humans.</p><p>An alternative
approach would be to test molecules that have potential
as anti-infectives but are not yet completely optimized. This is a
slower approach, since these molecules would still need preclinical
optimization and human testing, and so this is often seen as less
attractive given the pressing need for short-term solutions. However,
if such an approach had been taken when the Ebola virus was first
discovered in 1975, new agents could well have been available for
the epidemic in Liberia in 2014/2015. If there had been a more coordinated
search for new agents against SARS-CoV (1) after the outbreak in Hong
Kong in 2003, then the global armamentarium of drugs to fight SARS-CoV2
would have been stronger.</p><p>The difficulty with such an approach
is maintaining long-term funding
in the absence of a specific threat. Analysis of the U.S. NIH (National
Institutes of Health) spending according to the Research, Disease,
and Condition Categorization (RCDC) shows little investment in diseases
with less than 0.5 million DALYs (Disability Adjusted Life Years<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref></sup>). On the face of it, this is logical, even though
this means that fewer than ten of the classical neglected diseases
would be funded based on global public health impact (malaria, schistosomiasis,
dengue, hookworm, visceral leishmaniasis, onchocerciasis, ascariasis,
and rabies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref></sup>).</p><p>The challenge is therefore
how to efficiently catalyze drug discovery
in areas of emerging disease, where the associated DALYs have not
(yet) exceeded the threshold needed for large-scale investment. Clearly
this also has to involve more efficient use of existing resources
and thus the open sharing of information and reagents. Following the
release of the Malaria Box in 2011,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref></sup> MMV
(Medicines for Malaria Venture, Geneva, Switzerland) analyzed the
use of these open-source compounds,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref></sup> since
a large proportion of them were used by groups who were not actively
working on malaria. Several trends emerged: First, that for emerging
pathogens there are very few starting points for drug discovery, and
so access to compound sets enriched with scaffolds likely to cross
membranes and hit molecular targets was in high demand. Second, that
there was a clear scientific drive in the biology community to find
new molecules against emerging infectious diseases, with the establishment
of relevant assays indicative of disease pathology, where screening
of compound libraries is carried out under very stringent biosafety
conditions. There was a need to not only supply compounds but also
to offer additional services. With the MMV open platform,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref></sup> MMV has been able to supply standardized information
on metabolism and pharmacokinetics as well as early safety read-outs&#x02014;essential
for rapidly prioritizing any scaffolds that are positive. In addition,
an initial hit can be rapidly expanded to a series by compound purchase
and synthesis, but many of the project teams needed early medicinal
chemistry support. In short, it is possible to progress drug discovery
using the existing networks, but there was a need for catalytic investment
in chemistry, drug metabolism, and in managing the logistics of making
compounds available. With this it would be possible to form a community
of the willing. Additionally, the availability of a standard testing
set means that results can be compared between laboratories, and trends
around the impact of assay conditions and different pathogens can
be identified.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref></sup> Finally, these open-source
compound collections have been extremely useful in providing testing
sets of interesting molecules for those working in Low- and Middle-Income
Countries, and against rarely studied primary isolates of disease
(references for each Box are cited below).</p><p>There are several
commercial libraries of FDA-approved drugs available,
ranging from less than 1000 to almost 3000 compounds, at a cost of
around $5 per compound. If the drug being repositioned is an existing
anti-infective agent there is a fast route to clinical testing.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref></sup> This approach has been applied to emerging viral
pathogens, with tilorone and pyronaridine shown to be active against
the Ebola virus in infection assays.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref></sup> However, if
the initial cell biology hit is from a different therapeutic area,
the road from that hit to confirmation of activity in animals and
thence human patients can be a long one.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref></sup></p><p>One issue with registered drugs is that they have been optimized
for a specific pathogen; so, in the ideal case they represent a &#x0201c;home-run&#x0201d;.
However, if an optimal drug candidate cannot be directly identified,
it may be better to start with compounds from earlier in development
which have not been completely optimized against a specific target.
The ReFRAME collection was created by Calibr in 2018 as a collection
of 14&#x0202f;000 compounds based primarily on all compounds currently
in clinical development, stalled, or registered.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref></sup> This is an extremely powerful resource for facilities with
access to-high throughput screening technologies. Facing the inherent
threat of a new epidemic caused by a viral, bacterial, or fungal agent,
it was clear that a standard set of compounds would be valuable as
a resource for supporting work on emerging pathogens. To meet this
perceived need, MMV and DND<italic>i</italic> (Drugs for Neglected
Diseases <italic>initiative</italic>, Geneva, Switzerland) have collaborated
to generate a set of 400 compounds that span these three therapeutic
areas, focusing on a chemically and pharmacologically diverse mixture
of early stage, emerging anti-infective scaffolds, and more mature
compounds currently undergoing clinical development. The decision
to select a box of 400 compounds was framed by feedback from the biological
partners. With emerging infections, the number of new compounds that
can be tested is limited, given the need to use clinical isolates
of pathogens and, typically, nonrobotic procedures. The idea is not
primarily to identify new drugs to target today&#x02019;s emerging
pathogen(s) but to prepare a solid grounding and network of collaborators
who can work to develop therapeutic approaches to tomorrow&#x02019;s
pathogen before it emerges as a global threat.</p><p>The methodology
for the choice of compounds followed the previous
MMV<italic>open</italic> projects: the Malaria Box<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref></sup> and the Pathogen Box.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref></sup> The key criterion for selecting molecules for the Pandemic Response
Box was that they have demonstrated potent, preferably sub- micromolar
efficacy, against viral, bacterial or fungal microorganisms in <italic>in vitro</italic> assays. A few FDA-approved drugs, such as saquinavir,
itraconazole, levofloxacin, and tobramycin were inserted as positive
controls. However, for the rest of the set, there was a desire to
have a balance between compounds that were taken from discovery and
those with some development exposure. The discovery-sourced chemotypes
could be expected to be pleiotropic but have more risk in terms of
unknown side effects. However, this may increase the opportunities
for identifying a novel hit, as such discovery compounds may not be
fully optimized against a particular biological target or pathogen.
Chemotypes that have already been taken into development are somewhat
derisked but carry the counterbalance that this optimization may reduce
the possibility of having activity against other pathogens. &#x0201c;Launched&#x0201d;
compounds may have been registered locally or for specific indications
and formulations, which may or may not fit uses for other diseases.
Some molecules&#x02019; clinical development may also have been stopped
for commercial or disease-specific reasons which would not <italic>a priori</italic> prevent their use in pandemics. Although some molecules
may be covered by current intellectual property claims, it was considered
that by the time any new treatments have been clinically validated,
many of these claims will have expired. In any case, the assumption
is that the community will take a responsible view of intellectual
property.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref></sup> As such, some of the compounds
were purchased in bulk from suppliers, but many were made within the
project using in-house synthetic experience.</p><sec id="sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="sec2.1"><title>Selection of
the Pandemic Response Box Compounds</title><p>A
list of antibacterial and antiviral compounds that either had been
in clinical development or else represent promising scaffolds from
drug discovery was compiled from public domain databases. Promising
compounds from the discovery list were reviewed by a panel of medicinal
chemistry experts and were then combined with compounds selected from
chemotypes in clinical development. The details of the workflows are
outlined below. In general, compounds were not triaged using physicochemical
properties or structural alerts unless specified. From a compound
collection perspective, this would risk prematurely eliminating certain
drug classes or mechanisms of action. Such risks could be addressed
during future lead optimization campaigns.</p><sec id="sec2.1.1"><label>1</label><title>Antibacterial

development compounds were abstracted
from the Cortellis (Clarivate Analytics) database with molecules included
since 1990 (see <xref rid="notes-1" ref-type="notes">S1</xref> for details). Via this
process, 233 antibacterial development candidates were identified,
and therefore, no further triage of this list was performed. Abstraction
of antiviral development candidates from the Clarivate Analytics Cortellis
database identified 1336 compounds, so further triage was required.
These antiviral compounds were clustered and analyzed for molecular
properties such as molecular weight, published potency in cellular
assays, and pan-assay interference compounds (PAINS<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref></sup>). Viral selectivity and molecular target information were
captured for each compound, and one compound was picked per viral
family. In addition, one compound was picked per molecular target
for those targets not covered by the preceding organism-based selection.
Compound selection was guided by a Harrington multiparameter optimization
to bias toward potency and lower molecular weight:<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref></sup><list list-type="simple"><list-item><p>Weighted compounds

of 468 compounds representing development scaffolds.</p></sec><sec id="sec2.1.2"><label>2</label><title>Antibacterial and Antiviral Discovery Scaffolds</title><p>From
the ChEMBL database, compounds with defined antiviral or antibacterial

more than 20&#x0202f;000 compounds that was initially filtered by application
of the following physicochemical properties (these were chosen to
eliminate compounds with extreme properties but remain relaxed enough
to be inclusive at this stage):<list list-type="simple"><list-item><p>MW 200&#x02013;700; clogP 0&#x02013;7; HBA (hydrogen bond

compounds was then subjected
to the following triage (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref></xref>). Compounds that were overlapping with the previous
Clarivate Analytics list of development compounds were removed. Compounds
were then clustered based on a Tanimoto similarity of &#x0003e;0.5, and
the
compound with the lowest molecular weight selected to represent each
cluster. Clustering was performed with an in-house algorithm that
employs single linkage clustering and Morgan fingerprints. All pairwise
similarity values were calculated and compounds placed in the same
cluster if their Tanimoto similarity was above a threshold value.
Multiple similarity threshold values were used to enable interrogation
of cluster data at different levels of granularity. For example, compounds
could be viewed trellised by cluster calculated using a low similarity
value (e.g., 0.5), and colored by cluster calculated using a higher
similarity threshold (e.g., 0.7) to give a more informed view of the
space being analyzed. Some clusters were eliminated from the analysis
due to the presence of reactive functionalities such as aldehydes,
thiols, and oximes. This method selected 1000 compounds.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Workflow for

ChEMBL hits were reviewed. Compounds with a pathogen target or a molecular
target not already covered by the first 1000 compounds were prioritized
per target or organism on the basis of their MPO scores as described
above. This selected an additional 200 compounds. Finally, since this
overall initial list of 1200 promising discovery compounds was biased
2:1 in favor of antibacterials, a second member of each antiviral
cluster was added, resulting in a total of 748 antiviral compounds,
1543 discovery compounds in total.</p><p>These 1543 compounds were
then reviewed by an industry-experienced
medicinal chemistry panel. Two reviewers were randomly assigned per

selected or nonselected. Compounds selected by both reviewers were
reclustered to 70% similarity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref></sup> to reduce
the number of compounds representing each cluster to no more than
two. The coverage of targets and organisms was then reanalyzed to
identify any mechanisms that were no longer covered, and in that case,
compounds previously rejected by the reviewers were proposed for reintroduction
to cover these gaps. The resulting compounds were reduced to a collection
of 224 antibacterial and 204 antiviral discovery compounds, selected
with a preference for high potency, low clogP, and avoidance of complex
chemical structures.</p></sec><sec id="sec2.1.3"><label>3</label><title>Antifungal Compounds</title><p>A list of 300
antifungal compounds from discovery and development phases including

multiple formulations of the same compound. Formulation duplicates
and complex natural products were removed from the list to bring it
to a collection of 80 compounds. Since these compounds are representative
of antifungal targets reported in the literature, and given our earlier

This list was then supplemented with launched antibacterial compounds,
providing 294 compounds in total. This set was then reviewed a final
time by anti-infective experts to select 229 compounds for acquisition
(procurement or synthesis).</p><p>Similarly, for antivirals, compounds
were clustered by structure,
target virus, and molecular target, if known. Using this combination,
245 clusters were identified, and a representative from each cluster
was selected on the basis of commercial availability or synthetic
simplicity. From clusters that lacked either a defined molecular target
or a known target organism, one compound was selected. This list was
further supplemented with launched compounds and shared with experts
for final selection. After a final visual check, 230 compounds were
selected to ensure minimum chemical overlap and representation of
clusters.</p><p>A final list of 539 compounds, including 80 antifungals,
was assimilated
for procurement or synthesis. Compounds with high cost of synthesis
(&#x0003e;$1000 for &#x0223c;25 mg) were eliminated at this stage, leaving
around 40% of the compounds planned for synthesis. As experienced
earlier with the Malaria and Pathogen Boxes, a 20% attrition was observed
due to unexpected synthetic difficulties, high cost, or extended lead
time of starting materials or reagents. Furthermore, some of the synthesized
compounds were not included in the box because less than 30 mg could
be made. Of the 400 compounds that made it to the box, 164 were synthesized <italic>de novo</italic>.</p><sec id="sec2.2.1"><label>4</label><title>Composition of Pandemic Response

split between discovery and development/launched compounds. However,
the extreme synthetic complexity and lack of an affordable commercial
source for many of the development/launched compounds resulted in
a larger proportion of discovery compounds in the final box (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref></xref>). These molecules

of the Pandemic Response Box Compound
Set</title><p>Since the launch of the box in 2019 over 140 requests

among researchers to screen high-quality compound collections. The
wide geographic distribution of the recipients (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref></xref>) is a testament to the demand for this type
of discovery tool, with 42% coming from Africa, Asia, and Latin America.
Many of the recipient laboratories are located in regions where epidemic
outbreaks or pandemic origins are frequent. The distribution pattern
of this box is similar to what was observed with the Pathogen Box,
where 36% of the boxes went to these regions.</p><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6</label><caption><p>Distribution of the Pandemic

screening was observed in 2020, and by March 2020, MMV had already
shipped a few copies for screening in SARS-CoV2 assays. The set has
been screened in multiple assays developed to identify potential drugs
for treatment of SARS-CoV2. This has led to the identification of
active compounds <italic>in vitro</italic>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref>) that are being further characterized. The box has also been screened
against other different high-priority pathogens, many of which have
been listed as such by the U.S. CDC (Centers for Disease Control)
and WHO (World Health Organization).</p><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7</label><caption><p>Pathogen diversity for screening of Pandemic
