Approximately 20% of patients suffer a moderate to severe form of skin disease and up to 30% have joint involvement. Standard therapies for psoriasis include topical medications, phototherapy, and both oral systemic and biological therapies whereas therapies for psoriatic arthritis include nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs followed by disease modifying antirheumatic drugs and/or tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-&#x003b1; inhibitors and interleukin-12/23p40 inhibitors. Treatment of both diseases is typically driven by disease severity. In the past decade, major advances in the understanding of the immunopathogenesis of psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis have led to the development of numerous biological therapies, which have revolutionized the treatment for moderate to severe plaque psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis. Anti-TNF-&#x003b1; agents are currently considered as first line biological therapies for the treatment of moderate to severe psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis. Currently approved anti-TNF-&#x003b1; agents include etanercept, adalimumab, and infliximab for psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis as well as golimumab and certolizumab for psoriatic arthritis. In this article, we aim to evaluate the long term safety and efficacy of etanercept in psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Keywords</title><kwd>psoriasis</kwd><kwd>psoriatic arthritis</kwd><kwd>etanercept</kwd><kwd>biological therapy</kwd><kwd>tumor necrosis factor</kwd><kwd>safety</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Psoriasis (PsO) is an immune-mediated chronic disease that can affect both the skin and joints. It is characterized by well demarcated, erythematous plaques with an overlying silvery scale classically distributed on the extensor surfaces, scalp, and trunk, although it can affect any area of the skin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1-btt-8-169">Figure 1</xref>). Approximately 1% to 3% of the population suffers from PsO.<xref rid="b1-btt-8-169" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> Plaque PsO is the most common clinical form affecting approximately 80% of PsO patients.<xref rid="b2-btt-8-169" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> Other forms of PsO include guttate, pustular (generalized and localized), erythrodermic, and palmoplantar disease. PsO has been associated with a number of comorbid conditions including the metabolic syndrome, cardiovascular disease, inflammatory bowel disease, anxiety, depression, and of course psoriatic arthritis (PsA). PsA is a seronegative arthritis affecting up to 30% of patients with plaque PsO and has multiple clinical presentations.<xref rid="b3-btt-8-169" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="b4-btt-8-169" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> It is typically classified into five subtypes: asymmetric oligoarticular arthritis, symmetric polyarthritis, distal interphalangeal arthritis, spondylitis with or without sacroiliitis, and arthritis mutilans. Physical findings in patients with PsA can also include enthesitis and dactylitis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2-btt-8-169">Figure 2</xref>). The most common form of PsA is asymmetric, although any of these types of PsA can erode and destroy affected joints leading to loss of functional abilities and a considerable decline in quality of life.<xref rid="b5-btt-8-169" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></p><p>Treatment of psoriatic skin disease is based on disease severity and includes topical therapies for milder patients, phototherapy for mild to moderate disease, and oral systemic and biological agents in patients with moderate to severe skin disease. These therapeutic strategies can be used as monotherapy or in various combinations. Similarly, PsA treatment is based on disease severity and response to therapy and includes nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs for milder cases and disease modifying antirheumatic drugs, such as methotrexate and other immunosuppressants, and anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-&#x003b1; as well as the newer anti-interleukin (IL)-12/23p40 agents (ustekinumab) for more severe forms.</p><p>Biological therapies have revolutionized the management of PsO and PsA. In 1984, K&#x000f6;hler, Milstein, and Jerne were given the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for developing this novel technology (nobelprize.org). Since then, a myriad of biological therapies have been created to treat a number of inflammatory, immune-mediated diseases. Biological therapies include monoclonal antibodies as well as recombinant fusion receptor proteins, such as etanercept.</p><p>TNF-&#x003b1; plays a major role in the pathophysiology of both PsO and PsA.<xref rid="b6-btt-8-169" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> TNF-&#x003b1; levels are elevated in psoriatic skin lesions, serum samples, and synovial fluid.<xref rid="b3-btt-8-169" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> Anti-TNF-&#x003b1; therapy has shown efficacy in treating psoriatic skin lesions, joint pain and swelling, enthesitis, and dactylitis plus the ability to improve mobility, reduce radiographic progression of disease, and influence quality of life parameters.<xref rid="b7-btt-8-169" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> TNF-&#x003b1; inhibitors which are currently approved to treat PsO and PsA include etanercept, adalimumab, and infliximab while two additional anti-TNF-&#x003b1; agents, golimumab and certolizumab, are only approved for use in PsA.</p><p>Etanercept was the first TNF-&#x003b1; inhibitor to be approved for use in PsO and PsA. It is a dimeric, soluble fusion protein consisting of the extracellular ligand binding portion of the TNF receptor linked to the Fc portion of human IgG1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3-btt-8-169">Figure 3</xref>). It is capable of binding and neutralizing soluble TNF and transmembrane TNF.<xref rid="b8-btt-8-169" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> Furthermore, it alters neutrophil migration and dendritic cell and T-cell maturation and migration, thus decreasing the local and systemic production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and their subsequent effects.<xref rid="b6-btt-8-169" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="b9-btt-8-169" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> Etanercept was synthesized in the early 1990s<xref rid="b10-btt-8-169" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> and first tested in humans in 1992.<xref rid="b11-btt-8-169" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> In 2002 and 2004, etanercept was approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of PsA and in adult PsO patients, respectively.<xref rid="b12-btt-8-169" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> The recommended regimen for etanercept for patients with PsO is 50 mg twice weekly for 3 months, followed by a maintenance dose of 50 mg weekly. In children, doses of 0.8 mg/kg are used (up to a maximum of 50 mg) weekly. For PsA the recommended dose of etanercept is 50 mg weekly. This article will review available data on long term efficacy and safety of etanercept in PsO and PsA.</p></sec><sec><title>Etanercept efficacy in PsO</title><p>The first multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase III study took place in 652 patients with moderate to severe PsO who were randomized to either 25 mg weekly (QW), 25 mg twice weekly (BIW), or 50 mg BIW of etanercept or placebo.<xref rid="b13-btt-8-169" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> At week 12, 49%, 34%, and 14% of patients on 50 mg BIW, 25 mg BIW, and 25 mg QW, respectively, achieved a 75% decrease in Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) 75 scores as opposed to 4% of patients receiving placebo (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.001 for all three comparisons). At week 24, the percentage of patients achieving PASI 75 increased to 59%, 44%, and 25% of patients in the 50 mg BIW, 25 mg BIW, and 25 mg QW groups, respectively. Twenty-eight percent of the 652 randomized study subjects did not reach PASI 50 at any point during the trial (PASI 50 nonresponders) and were enrolled in a 36-week open label extension receiving 50 mg QW.<xref rid="b14-btt-8-169" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> During the 36-week open label extension, 72% and 38% of subjects received treatment through to at least week 48 (week 24 of open label extension) and week 60 (week 36 of open label extension), respectively. At week 36 (week 12 of open label extension), 43% of the PASI 50 nonresponders achieved PASI 50 or better response, and at week 60 (week 36 of open label extension), 55% and 23% of subjects achieved PASI 50 and PASI 75 responses, respectively. The mean percentage improvement for this group of PASI 50 nonresponders increased from 26.6% at week 24 (open label baseline) to 49.3% at week 60 (open label week 36). The quality of life, assessed by the Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) showed a mean improvement of 38.8% from the initial baseline (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t1-btt-8-169">Table 1</xref>).</p><p>In 2007, Tyring et al published data on the 84-week open label extension<xref rid="b15-btt-8-169" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> of a Phase III, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter study evaluating the efficacy and safety of 50 mg BIW of etanercept versus placebo at 12 weeks.<xref rid="b16-btt-8-169" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> In the open label extension, 591 of the original 618 subjects received etanercept 50 mg BIW for an additional 84 weeks, regardless of their treatment group prior to week 13. At week 24 (week 12 of open label extension) in the placebo/etanercept group, subjects achieved clinical improvement comparable to those patients in the original etanercept group at week 12. By week 96, PASI 50, PASI 75, and PASI 90 response rates were 79.1%, 51.6%, and 22.8%, respectively, for the placebo/etanercept group and 82.6%, 51.1%, and 23.2%, respectively, for the etanercept/etanercept group. PASI 75 responses reached a plateau at week 48 and of the subjects who achieved a PASI 75 response at week 48 and were reevaluated at week 96, 74.4% maintained a PASI 75 response. Among the reasons for the observed loss of efficacy was lack of patients&#x02019; adherence to the therapeutic regimen. In patients who were less than 90% adherent to therapy, responses declined by more than 20% from week 48 to 96, in comparison with a decrease of only 10% in patients with at least 90% adherence. Of the subjects who did not achieve a PASI 75 at week 48, 17.4% were PASI 75 responders at week 96. Mean baseline DLQI scores for the placebo/etanercept and etanercept/etanercept groups were 12.5 and 12.1, respectively, and at week 96 those values had decreased to 3.7 and 3.5, respectively, with the only statistically significant DLQI response rates occurring at week 12 between the treatment and placebo groups (77% versus 40%, <italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.001). Of note, during the initial 12 week study,<xref rid="b16-btt-8-169" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> fatigue and depression were assessed with the functional assessment of chronic illness therapy fatigue (FACIT-F) scale, the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (Ham-D), and the Beck depression inventory (BDI). BDI and Ham-D improvement rates were 55% for the etanercept group versus 39% for the placebo group (<italic>P</italic>=0.001) and 43% for the etanercept group versus 32% for the placebo group (<italic>P</italic>=0.0048), respectively. Furthermore, fatigue scores also improved showing at week 12 that patients receiving etanercept had an improvement in FACIT-F of 58% compared with 43% in those receiving placebo (<italic>P</italic>=0.0001). Interestingly, 18.3% of patients in this long term study were found to have anti-etanercept antibodies. However, these antibodies were determined to be nonneutralizing and did not appear to affect efficacy of treatment. Although this figure of 18.3% of subjects was higher than previously reported proportions (approximately 6% of adult patients with rheumatoid arthritis, PsA, ankylosing spondylitis, or plaque PsO),<xref rid="b17-btt-8-169" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> all prior studies also indicated that these antibodies had no effect on efficacy or safety profiles.</p><p>Two randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter American and global Phase III trials,<xref rid="b13-btt-8-169" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="b18-btt-8-169" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> were followed by an open label extension study published in 2010 by Leonardi et al.<xref rid="b19-btt-8-169" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> In this study,<xref rid="b19-btt-8-169" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> subjects initially received 50 mg etanercept QW for the first 12 weeks. Thereafter, eligible patients could maintain the 50 mg QW dose or escalate to 50 mg BIW based on a lack of clinical response (inability to achieve of PASI 75, significant residual disease, or residual disease in highly aesthetic or functional areas of significance) and continue the chosen therapy for up to 72 weeks. Of the 912 subjects enrolled in the extension study, 818 (89.7%) completed 48 weeks of treatment, and 485 subjects (53.2%) completed 72 weeks of treatment. Five hundred ninety-one subjects (64.8%) increased their dose to 50 mg BIW at some point after week 12 while the remaining 321 subjects (35.2%) maintained their dose at 50 mg QW. The mean weights were higher in the increased dose versus maintained dose groups (93.2 kg versus 87.6 kg). Similarly, baseline mean PASI scores of the parent (19.5 versus 17.7) and extension studies (6.3 versus 8.8&#x02013;8.9) were higher in the increased dose group compared to the maintained dose group. In the maintained dose group, the percentage improvement in the mean PASI score was 65% at baseline of the extension and 75%, 77%, and 75% at weeks 12, 48, and 72, respectively, while mean percentage of improvement in the mean PASI score for the increased dose group was 54% at baseline and 60%, 67%, and 67% at weeks 12, 48, and 72, respectively. Furthermore, a Physician&#x02019;s Global Assessment (PGA) score of 0 or 1 remained stable during the extension and was achieved by 54% and 51% of subjects at weeks 48 and 72, respectively, in the maintained dose group. In the increased dose group, a PGA score of 0 or 1 was achieved by 28% of subjects who increased their dose at week 48 and 27% at week 72. In subjects without dose escalation, PASI 50, 75, and 90 were observed in 90%, 60%, and 27%, respectively, at week 72. In the increased dose group, PASI 50, 75, and 90 responses were observed in 83%, 43%, and 10% of subjects, respectively, at week 72. Mean DLQI scores were improved by 55% at baseline of the extension, by 76% at 48 weeks in the maintained dose group, and by 45% and 64% at baseline and week 48, respectively, in the increased dose group.</p><p>In 2012 Papp et al<xref rid="b20-btt-8-169" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> performed a post hoc analysis on prospective efficacy and safety data for up to 4 years of etanercept use in PsO from a cohort of 506 Canadian patients who had participated in at least one of four previous studies.<xref rid="b15-btt-8-169" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="b16-btt-8-169" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="b18-btt-8-169" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="b19-btt-8-169" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="b21-btt-8-169" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> Subjects had received either etanercept 25 mg BIW, 50 mg QW, or 50 mg BIW, based on the trial with which they had commenced therapy. This study represents the longest published experience to date as previously published data did not extend beyond 2.5 years. Effectiveness endpoints were changes from baseline DLQI and static PGA scores completed at 3 month intervals throughout the course of the studies. Across all studies, 29.1% of subjects discontinued therapy prematurely. The most common reasons for premature discontinuation were withdrawal of consent and disease progression (11.3% and 5.5%, respectively). At baseline, the mean DLQI score for subjects included in the cohort was 11.1&#x000b1;6.5 and the mean static PGA score was 3.2&#x000b1;0.7, with 86.8% of subjects scoring 3 to 5 points (moderate to very severe) and only one (0.2%) subject scoring 1 (almost clear). In the as-treated analysis, 74.3% were DLQI responders at 3 months and 75.9% achieved DLQI responses through 48 months. The proportion of subjects scoring clear or almost clear on the static PGA scale was 45.3% and 41.6% at 3 and 12 weeks, respectively. However, by 24 months, the proportion of patients had dropped to 28.6% and was maintained at 29.2% and 27.8% at months 36 and 48, respectively. In addition, over the entire 48-month period, 141 (27.9%) subjects had treatment gaps of greater than 8 weeks between study protocols. At 12 weeks after restarting therapy, DLQI response improved to a level similar to that seen before stopping therapy. Mean DLQI prior to stopping therapy was 3.0 with 73% of subjects as responders. At restart of therapy, mean DLQI and proportion responders were 8.6% and 29.8%, respectively, and 12 weeks after restarting therapy, mean DLQI and proportion responders were 2.6% and 77.9%, respectively. Static PGA response followed a similar trend after a treatment gap, as patients recovered static PGA response at 12 weeks after restarting therapy and maintained response through 24 weeks after a treatment gap. This study was the first of its kind and showed that etanercept is effective in long term treatment of PsO, sustaining treatment response for up to 4 years.</p><p>It is worth noting that PsO has several associated comorbidities, including cardiovascular disease and metabolic syndrome. A retrospective study<xref rid="b22-btt-8-169" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> found that etanercept was associated with a significant reduction of myocardial infarction (MI) risk (hazard ratio, 0.53; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.31&#x02013;0.92). There were no statistically significant changes of MI risk associated with the length of the treatment. A separate Italian cohort<xref rid="b23-btt-8-169" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> followed 210 patients for 24 months to assess response in metabolic parameters. Patients were assigned into three groups and treated with etanercept, adalimumab, or methotrexate. The number of PsA patients affected by metabolic syndrome did not change significantly in the different treatment groups. However, there was a trend toward a reduction in the metabolic syndrome prevalence in the etanercept and adalimumab groups at 24 months of therapy.</p></sec><sec><title>Etanercept efficacy in PsA</title><p>Etanercept has previously been shown to be efficacious for PsA treatment in several short term studies for up to 24 weeks.<xref rid="b24-btt-8-169" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b26-btt-8-169" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> Long term efficacy was evaluated in an open label extension<xref rid="b27-btt-8-169" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> of a previously published study<xref rid="b26-btt-8-169" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> in which 169 patients continued treatment with subcutaneous etanercept 25 mg BIW for up to 48 weeks. Subject response to therapy was determined using 20% improvement in the American College of Rheumatology scores (ACR) 20 together with radiographic progression of disease as determined by the Sharp method modified to include joints frequently affected by PsA, PsA response criteria (PsARC), and PASI scores. ACR 20 was achieved by 64% and 63% of those initially assigned to either etanercept or placebo, respectively, while 44% and 49%, respectively, achieved ACR 50 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t2-btt-8-169">Table 2</xref>). These results were similar to those found in the initial study, and were sustained until week 48. ACR 20 and ACR 50 responses were comparable in both groups subsequent to week 12. The PsARC criteria were achieved by 80% of the patients assigned originally to etanercept. The patients assigned to placebo achieved similar results subsequent to12 weeks of etanercept, a result maintained throughout the length of the study. Patients originally assigned to etanercept maintained an inhibition of radiologic progression for up to 2 years of treatment. Mean adjusted Total Sharp Score from baseline to 2 years was &#x02212;0.38. In patients originally assigned to placebo, radiographic disease progression was decreased subsequent to etanercept initiation. The decrease in Total Sharp Score between the first and second year, in patients assigned first to placebo and then to etanercept, was comparable to the response observed after 1 year in patients originally treated with etanercept. In terms of radiographic disease progression, the addition of methotrexate or corticosteroids to treatment did not appear to show any significant differences. There is no clear consensus as to whether the use of methotrexate improves drug survival by decreasing adverse events (AEs).<xref rid="b28-btt-8-169" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b32-btt-8-169" ref-type="bibr">32</xref> The percentage of patients showing no radiographic disease progression was higher in the group assigned to etanercept earlier.<xref rid="b27-btt-8-169" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> These studies showed long term efficacy of etanercept in treatment of PsA and its beneficial effect on prevention of further radiographic disease progression.

Exposure-adjusted rates (EARs) of all AEs and infections were similar to those observed during the initial 12-week double-blind portion of the study. During the 60 week extension, most AEs were of mild to moderate intensity. Four patients had injection site reactions (3, mild intensity; 1, moderate). Seven patients discontinued the open label study because of AEs. One patient had a serious infection (cellulitis), and one patient died approximately 1 month after the last dose of the study drug.

Nevertheless, no significant differences in EARs of AEs, severe adverse events (SAEs), or infections were observed between patients who increased their dose of etanercept to 50 mg BIW versus those who maintained their dose at 50 mg QW. Seventeen serious infections occurred in 12 patients during the extension study. The most common serious infections were three events of pneumonia in the 50 mg QW group and two events of cellulitis in the group that increased the dose. Fifty-nine serious noninfectious AEs occurred in 46 patients during the extension study. The most common serious noninfectious events were two events of subdural hematoma in the QW group and two events of MI and nephrolithiasis in the 50 mg BIW group. No cases of tuberculosis, opportunistic infection, demyelinating diseases, or lymphoma were reported during the extension study. The rate of all malignancies in this study was 1.5 events per 100 PY and a comparable rate of malignancies was reported in the Medicaid program (1.9 events per 100 PY for patients with less severe PsO and 2.9 events per 100 PY for patients with severe PsO).<xref rid="b19-btt-8-169" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> The number of observed squamous cell carcinomas (SCCs) was not significantly different from the expected number in the Arizona-based data (a highly sun-exposed population), but it was significantly higher than the expected number in the Minnesota-based data (a less sun-exposed population).<xref rid="b19-btt-8-169" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> The number of observed BCCs was significantly lower than the expected number in the Arizona-based study.<xref rid="b19-btt-8-169" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> Nonneutralizing antibodies to etanercept were detected in 15.2% of patients.

The rates of serious noninfectious and infectious AEs were similar between the etanercept treatment groups analyzed; they were also stable over time and the AE rates reported in the long term analyses are consistent with those reported in the short term analyses. The most commonly reported noninfectious AEs were headache, arthralgia, injection site hemorrhage, and back pain.

The most common SAE included MI (0.6 events per 100 PY) and BCC (0.3 events per 100 PY). The rate of SAE occurred at a rate smaller than 1.0 event per 100 PY of exposure. The EAR for all infectious and serious infectious AE at study completion was 96.9 and 0.9 events per 100 PY, respectively. Infection rates were similar while on etanercept therapy, regardless of the dose received. No cases of tuberculosis or opportunistic infections were reported. Nineteen malignancies (EAR of 1.5 per 100 PY) were reported at study completion and were not considered to be related to etanercept. The incidence rate of all malignancies, excluding nonmelanoma skin cancer (NMSC), observed at study completion was consistent with the expected rate in the general population. No statistically significant difference was seen between the observed and expected rates of BCC and SCC with either comparator database. EARs for all reported cardiovascular events (n=37) and serious cardiovascular events (n=22) were 2.8 and 1.7 events per 100 PY, respectively.

However, because etanercept is a relatively large molecule, it would not be expected to be absorbed by a neonate&#x02019;s immature gastrointestinal system during breastfeeding. Nevertheless, given the observed mild increase in the rate of birth defects, etanercept should be used in pregnancy only if no other options are available. It is important to realize that PsO pregnancies do have a higher risk of side effects versus the normal population.<xref rid="b74-btt-8-169" ref-type="bibr">74</xref></p></sec></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>PsO and PsA are chronic, immune-mediated inflammatory diseases associated with several comorbidities. The evidence of their impact in other organs has led to a major change in the definition of these diseases, once considered only limited to skin and/or joints. Now, both are considered systemic diseases. In the past two decades, our understanding of the pathophysiology of PsO has advanced enormously. These advances have been paralleled by the development of new, highly efficacious therapeutic options. Etanercept is one example of the new era in PsO therapeutics. As with any major advance in medicine, the advent of biological agents has come to fruition because of numerous large scale, multicenter randomized controlled trials to evaluate their efficacy and safety. Over the past decade, etanercept has proven to be efficacious as monotherapy or when used in combination with other PsO treatments. With any new medication, particularly one specifically targeting the immune system, rigorous attainment of safety data has been crucial in providing more appropriate guidelines for treatment. Specifically, various biologically agents have been associated with serious infections such as, tuberculosis and hepatitis B reactivation, demyelinating diseases, lymphomas, leukemia, and NMSC and should be used with caution taking every patient&#x02019;s specific needs into account. Nevertheless, many of these associations occurred at rates similar to those observed in the general population or at such small rates that the benefit of treating PsO patients clearly outweighs the risks mentioned. It has been two decades since etanercept&#x02019;s first human trials in 1993, and after almost a decade since its Food and Drug Administration approval, etanercept is still an important and valuable option in any physician&#x02019;s arsenal for the treatment of moderate to severe PsO and/or PsA.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Disclosure</bold></p><p>BM has no conflicts of interest to report.
