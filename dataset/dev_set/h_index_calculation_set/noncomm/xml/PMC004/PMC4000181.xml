Three types of MWCNTs &#x02013; VGCF<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>-X, VGCF<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>-S, and VGCF<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> (vapor grown carbon fibers; with diameters of 15, 80, and 150 nm, respectively) &#x02013; and three CSCNTs of different lengths (CS-L, 20&#x02013;80 &#x003bc;m; CS-S, 0.5&#x02013;20 &#x003bc;m; and CS-M, of intermediate length) were tested. Human bronchial epithelial (BEAS-2B) and malignant pleural mesothelioma cells were exposed to the CNTs (1&#x02013;50 &#x003bc;g/mL), and cell viability, permeability, uptake, total reactive oxygen species/superoxide production, and intracellular acidity were measured. CSCNTs were less toxic than MWCNTs in both cell types over a 24-hour exposure period. The cytotoxicity of endocytosed MWCNTs varied according to cell type/size, while that of CSCNTs depended on tube length irrespective of cell type. CNT diameter and length influenced cell aggregation and injury extent. Intracellular acidity increased independently of lysosomal activity along with the number of vacuoles in BEAS-2B cells exposed for 24 hours to either CNT (concentration, 10 &#x003bc;g/mL). However, total reactive oxygen species/superoxide generation did not contribute to cytotoxicity. The results demonstrate that CSCNTs could be suitable for biological applications and that CNT shape and size can have differential effects depending on cell type, which can be exploited in the development of highly specialized, biocompatible CNTs.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Keywords</title><kwd>multi-walled carbon nanotube</kwd><kwd>cup-stacked carbon nanotube</kwd><kwd>cytotoxicity</kwd><kwd>in vitro</kwd><kwd>intracellular acidity</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Due to their unique physicochemical properties, carbon nanotubes (CNTs) have applications in a wide variety of industries.

Mice injected intraperitoneally with CNTs exhibited toxicological changes similar to those induced by exposure to asbestos,<xref rid="b5-ijn-9-1979" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="b6-ijn-9-1979" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> and CNTs have been linked to the induction of mesotheliomas.<xref rid="b7-ijn-9-1979" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="b8-ijn-9-1979" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> Although some in vivo studies have been conducted on the safety of CNT exposure by inhalation or intratracheal administration, their findings have been indeterminate.<xref rid="b9-ijn-9-1979" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b13-ijn-9-1979" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> Results from in vitro studies have also been ambiguous, with some studies reporting that CNTs induce cytotoxicity and cytokine production,<xref rid="b14-ijn-9-1979" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b18-ijn-9-1979" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> and others showing that no significant biological responses are elicited.<xref rid="b19-ijn-9-1979" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="b20-ijn-9-1979" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></p><p>Many reasons have been proposed for these contradictory findings. First, CNTs can be single-walled, multi-walled (MWCNTs), as well as cup-stacked (CSCNTs), and can differ in terms of length and diameter as well as physiochemical properties such as shape, agglomeration, surface structure, and carbon defects, any of which can influence the toxicological evaluation.<xref rid="b21-ijn-9-1979" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b27-ijn-9-1979" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> Moreover, impurities in CNTs have been shown to induce oxidative stress, resulting in cellular damage.<xref rid="b28-ijn-9-1979" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="b29-ijn-9-1979" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> Other factors besides the CNT itself, such as experimental conditions, have also been suggested to contribute to a misleading toxicity evaluation.<xref rid="b14-ijn-9-1979" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="b30-ijn-9-1979" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="b31-ijn-9-1979" ref-type="bibr">31</xref> Two recent studies by our group examined the possible factors contributing to the variable cytotoxicity of CNTs in vitro. In one study, it was found that cytotoxicity differed according to the dispersant that is used.<xref rid="b32-ijn-9-1979" ref-type="bibr">32</xref> CNTs dispersed with gelatin or 1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine were endocytosed and induced concentration-dependent cytotoxicity and cytokine secretion, while the same was not observed when carboxymethyl cellulose was used instead. Varying degrees of cytotoxicity were also observed in different cell lines.<xref rid="b33-ijn-9-1979" ref-type="bibr">33</xref> MWCNTs were endocytosed by, and were toxic to, malignant pleural mesothelioma, bronchial epithelial, and macrophage-like cells, but not neuroblastoma and monoblastic cells. Endocytosed MWCNTs accumulated in the lysosome, causing injury to the membrane. However, endocytosed carbon black, a carbon allotrope, had no cytotoxic effects despite settling in the lysosome. This indicates that the toxicity associated with CNTs, which are internalized due to their nanosize, is not an inherent property of the constituent carbon (which is considered inert), but is actually due to other factors.</p><p>In the present study, we investigated whether the physical dimensions and type of CNTs influence cellular response. MWCNTs (Showa Denko KK, Tokyo, Japan) and CSCNTs (GSI Creos, Tokyo, Japan) of various diameters and lengths were tested in two different epithelial cell lines, in which responses were evaluated based on several biological parameters. The findings indicate that the cellular response to CNTs is dependent on multiple factors, which should be considered while developing CNTs that have optimal biocompatibility.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>CNT preparation</title><p>The properties of the MWCNTs are listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="t1-ijn-9-1979">Table 1</xref>, and those of the CSCNTs<xref rid="b34-ijn-9-1979" ref-type="bibr">34</xref> are listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="t2-ijn-9-1979">Table 2</xref>.

The toxicity of CSCNTs in BEAS-2B cells was dependent on concentration and length (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1-ijn-9-1979">Figure 1B</xref>).

Although a similar distribution of the fibers was observed with VGCF-X and CS-S, for the former, only a portion of the agglomerate was inside the lysosome while the majority of fibers penetrated the plasma membrane, as opposed to CS-S fibers, which were mostly in the lysosomal compartment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3-ijn-9-1979">Figure 3Ad</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3-ijn-9-1979">3Ag</xref>). CS-Ms were observed as both single fibers and aggregates and appeared as a mixture of CS-Ls and CS-Ss (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3-ijn-9-1979">Figure 3Af</xref>). There was no overlap in the signals of early endosomes and CNTs in the cytoplasm of BEAS-2B and MESO-1 cells. The lysosomal distribution of VGCF, VGCF-S, and CS-L was more clearly visible by TEM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4-ijn-9-1979">Figure 4Ab</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4-ijn-9-1979">4Ac</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4-ijn-9-1979">4Ae</xref>).

In TEM images, a few isolated VGCF and VGCF-S fibers were observed adjacent to nuclei (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4-ijn-9-1979">Figure 4Bb</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4-ijn-9-1979">4Bc</xref>), while the other CNTs were present as aggregates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4-ijn-9-1979">Figure 4Bd</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4-ijn-9-1979">g</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>MWCNTs stimulate ROS production in BEAS-2B cells</title><p>The total ROS production in BEAS-2B cells exposed to MWCNTs and CSCNTs is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5-ijn-9-1979">Figure 5A</xref>. Oxidative stress was significantly upregulated, and superoxide dismutase activity was slightly increased by VGCF-X compared to that for the positive control pyocyanin. An increase in oxidative stress level was observed in MESO-1 cells exposed to VGCF-X (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5-ijn-9-1979">Figure 5B</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>CNTs induce lysosomal acidification upon uptake</title><p>An acidotropic probe, which accumulates in acidic organelles and exhibits pH-dependent increases in fluorescence intensity upon acidification, was used to evaluate changes in intracellular acidity upon exposure to CNTs. Cells that had internalized CNTs were isolated by flow cytometry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6-ijn-9-1979">Figure 6A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6-ijn-9-1979">B</xref>). BEAS-2B cells exposed to 50 &#x003bc;g/mL MWCNTs were not analyzed because a sufficient number of living cells could not be obtained for analysis due to the toxicity of MWCNTs at this concentration. Increases in intensity upon exposure of BEAS-2B cells to 1 &#x003bc;g/mL VGCF, VGCF-S, and VGCF-X were 10.8%, 7.5%, and 17.5%, respectively, while, for CSCNTs at the same concentration, the values were &#x0003c;5% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6-ijn-9-1979">Figure 6A</xref>). However, at 10 &#x003bc;g/mL, all CNTs induced increases in intensity of &#x0003e;10% in BEAS-2B cells. In contrast, in MESO-1 cells, changes were mostly &#x02264;10%, with VGCF and VGCF-S (at 50 &#x003bc;g/mL) accounting for more than 30% of the total increase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6-ijn-9-1979">Figure 6B</xref>). To determine whether acidification was due to CNT uptake, the lysosomes of BEAS-2B cells exposed to 10 &#x003bc;g/mL CNT and treated with the acidotropic probe were visualized, while control cells were double-stained with Lysosomes-RFP dye and emitted orange fluorescence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6-ijn-9-1979">Figure 6C</xref>). Small vacuoles were observed in CNT-exposed cells, but CNT aggregates were visible only in lysosomes, confirming that the observed increases in intensity were due to lysosomal CNT uptake.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>A major concern for the use of CNTs is their safety, since their shape is similar to that of asbestos. Although CNTs need to be internalized by cells in order to be useful as carriers, intracellular accumulation can be cytotoxic.<xref rid="b32-ijn-9-1979" ref-type="bibr">32</xref> A number of studies have investigated the biodegradability of CNTs in an attempt to address this issue.<xref rid="b37-ijn-9-1979" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b39-ijn-9-1979" ref-type="bibr">39</xref> However, CNTs are inherently stable, and degradation by chemical modification has yet to be developed. Therefore, the present study examined the optimal CNT shape and size that can maximize biocompatibility using two different types of CNT.</p><p>Both BEAS-2B and MESO-1 cells internalized MWCNTs, but different cytotoxic effects were observed in each cell line. In BEAS-2B cells, toxicity varied as a function of diameter, such that the toxicity was VGCF &#x0003e; VGCF-X &#x0003e; VGCF-S, while for MESO-1 cells, the order was VGCF &#x0003e; VGCF-S &#x02265; VGCF-X (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1-ijn-9-1979">Figure 1</xref>). In another study, macrophages, but not mesothelial or epithelial cells, were shown to take up MWCNTs, whereas cytotoxicity was comparable to what was observed in BEAS-2B cells or MESO-1 cells in the present study.<xref rid="b8-ijn-9-1979" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> The discordance between those results and ours may be the difference in internalization time. The previous study evaluated CNT uptake after 3 hours of MWCNT exposure, and evaluated cytotoxicity on the fourth day. Cellular uptake is dependent on time and cell type, and therefore a 3-hour exposure may be too short to evaluate the full extent of endocytosis.<xref rid="b14-ijn-9-1979" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="b32-ijn-9-1979" ref-type="bibr">32</xref> In contrast, CSCNTs were not toxic to MESO-1 cells; however, in BEAS-2B cells, toxicity was also dependent on size (in this case, length), with toxicity values of CS-L &#x02265; CS-M &#x0003e; CS-S (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1-ijn-9-1979">Figure 1</xref>). These results are consistent with reports that have demonstrated a positive association between CNT length and cytotoxicity.<xref rid="b5-ijn-9-1979" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="b40-ijn-9-1979" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>,<xref rid="b41-ijn-9-1979" ref-type="bibr">41</xref> Although the cytotoxicity of CSCNTs of a given diameter was comparable between cell lines, VGCF-X, which is shorter than VGCF-S, was more toxic to BEAS-2B cells. VGCF-X had the shortest length and smallest diameter among the CNTs tested in this study. However, VGCF-X agglomerates had the largest diameter, and, as such, were not taken up by BEAS-2B cells, nor did they fully penetrate the cell membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3-ijn-9-1979">Figures 3d</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4-ijn-9-1979">4f</xref>). We previously reported that the volume of BEAS-2B cells is less than half of that of MESO-1 cells.<xref rid="b32-ijn-9-1979" ref-type="bibr">32</xref> Smaller cells may be more susceptible to cytotoxicity because of incomplete endocytosis of a CNT aggregate. This is supported by the observation that LDH activity was highest in BEAS-2B cells exposed to VGCF-X. Moreover, the fact that CS-L and CS-M induced cytotoxicity to a comparable or lesser degree than VGCF despite their greater lengths could indicate that cytotoxicity is related to CNT rigidity, which has been previously suggested.<xref rid="b8-ijn-9-1979" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> Although CSCNTs were similar in diameter to VGCF-S, they have greater flexibility, which predisposes them to becoming more easily tangled. Indeed, CS-M and CS-S appeared to be tangled inside lysosomes in the TEM and LSM images (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3-ijn-9-1979">Figures 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4-ijn-9-1979">4</xref>). Furthermore, CS-L and VGCF-S aggregates have similar shape (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3-ijn-9-1979">Figure 3</xref>) and comparable cytotoxicity values. These results demonstrate that CNT toxicity is a function not only of tube length and rigidity, but also cell and aggregate sizes, and it is therefore imprudent to make generalizations about toxicity without considering multiple parameters.</p><p>VGCF-X was the only CNT that caused an increase in total ROS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5-ijn-9-1979">Figure 5</xref>). This indicates that CNTs are not, in general, inducers of oxidative stress in cells. It was recently shown that CNTs can act as OH radical scavengers.<xref rid="b12-ijn-9-1979" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="b42-ijn-9-1979" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b44-ijn-9-1979" ref-type="bibr">44</xref> However, VGCF-X has a higher iron content than VGCF or VGCF-S, since it was not subjected to iron removal heat treatment, and iron is a potential source of ROS. Nonetheless, stimulation of intracellular total ROS production did not directly contribute to cytotoxicity in MESO-1 cells.</p><p>We speculated that damage to the lysosome could be the cause of cytotoxicity. In fact, non-aggregated VGCF and VGCF-S penetrated the lysosomal membrane, as seen in the TEM images (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4-ijn-9-1979">Figure 4Ac</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4-ijn-9-1979">e</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4-ijn-9-1979">4Bc</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4-ijn-9-1979">e</xref>). Despite this, the signal intensity of injured, fluorescently labeled lysosomes remained unchanged. We recently reported that highly purified MWCNTs induced the expression of the autophagic marker light chain 3B, and 3-MA &#x02013; a widely used inhibitor of autophagosome formation &#x02013; reduced MWCNT-induced cytotoxicity in BEAS-2B cells.<xref rid="b45-ijn-9-1979" ref-type="bibr">45</xref> This was further validated by the present observation that cells exposed to CNTs showed increased acidification as a result of autophagy.<xref rid="b46-ijn-9-1979" ref-type="bibr">46</xref> Intracellular acidification was observed in MESO-1 cells only when exposed to VGCF and VGCF-S at a concentration of 50 &#x003bc;g/mL, whereas VGCF-X used at the same concentration did not have this effect while inducing a comparable degree of cytotoxicity as VGCF-S. This study was unable to clarify how autophagy was triggered. However, since acidification was unlikely to occur in lysosomes that had endocytosed CS-S, as in the case of carbon black (reported in our previous study),<xref rid="b33-ijn-9-1979" ref-type="bibr">33</xref> it is probable that the shape and size of CNTs are involved in promoting autophagy.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The cellular response to different types of CNTs of various dimensions was evaluated. CSCNTs, with their larger surface area, are more useful for functionalization, and the length can be adjusted by ball milling.<xref rid="b34-ijn-9-1979" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>,<xref rid="b47-ijn-9-1979" ref-type="bibr">47</xref> CSCNTs were also more biocompatible than MWCNTs, and therefore have greater potential as a nanobiomaterial, despite being slightly toxic. The cytotoxicity of both CNTs was dependent on many factors, including CNT shape (length, diameter, and aggregation), but also varied according to cell type. Therefore, it is necessary to confirm biocompatibility in each target cell type when considering the use of CNTs as a nanobiomaterial.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>The authors thank the staff at the Division of Instrumental Analysis in the Research Center for Human and Environmental Sciences of Shinshu University for their assistance.
