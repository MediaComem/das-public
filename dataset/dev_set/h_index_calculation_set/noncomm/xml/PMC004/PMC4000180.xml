Biodistribution and toxicity assessment are critical for the development of nanoparticle-based drugs, because of nanoparticle-enhanced biological reactivity. Here, we investigated the uptake, in vivo biodistribution, and in vitro and in vivo potential toxicity of manganese ferrite (MnFe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>) nanoparticles, synthesized by an original high-yield, low-cost mechanochemical process. Cultures of murine Balb/3T3 fibroblasts were exposed for 24, 48, or 72 hours to increasing ferrofluid concentrations. Nanoparticle cellular uptake was assessed by flow-cytometry scatter-light measurements and microscopy imaging after Prussian blue staining; cytotoxicity was evaluated by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) and colony-forming assays. After a single intravenous injection, in vivo nanoparticle biodistribution and clearance were evaluated in mice by Mn spectrophotometric determination and Prussian blue staining in the liver, kidneys, spleen, and brain at different posttreatment times up to 21 days. The same organs were analyzed for any possible histopathological change. The in vitro study demonstrated dose-dependent nanoparticle uptake and statistically significant cytotoxic effects from a concentration of 50 &#x003bc;g/mL for the MTT assay and 20 &#x003bc;g/mL for the colony-forming assay. Significant increases in Mn concentrations were detected in all analyzed organs, peaking at 6 hours after injection and then gradually declining. Clearance appeared complete at 7 days in the kidneys, spleen, and brain, whereas in the liver Mn levels remained statistically higher than in vehicle-treated mice up to 3 weeks postinjection. No evidence of irreversible histopathological damage to any of the tested organs was observed. A comparison of the lowest in vitro toxic concentration with the intravenously injected dose and the administered dose of other ferrofluid drugs currently in clinical practice suggests that there might be sufficient safety margins for further development of our formulation.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Keywords</title><kwd>biodistribution</kwd><kwd>biosafety</kwd><kwd>ICP-MS</kwd><kwd>Prussian blue staining</kwd><kwd>MnFe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub> nanoparticles</kwd><kwd>ferrofluid</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>In the last decade, many nanoparticle-based therapeutics have entered the pharmaceutical pipeline to improve the efficacy and reduce the systemic toxicity of a wide range of drugs. In fact, nanoparticle chemical and physical properties, such as shape, size, magnetic behavior, surface charge, and functionalization can be engineered to modulate pharmacokinetics, biodistribution, diffusivity through the extracellular matrix, and interaction at cellular and subcellular levels. Therefore, nanotherapeutics are being exploited to potentially overcome biological barriers, deliver hydrophobic drugs at preferential target sites of disease, or prepare formulations of unstable (eg, small interfering ribonucleic acid) and/or highly toxic drugs.<xref rid="b1-ijn-9-1919" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b3-ijn-9-1919" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></p><p>Superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles offer attractive possibilities for the improvement of site-specific drug delivery, thanks to their transportation to targeted areas by an external magnetic field.<xref rid="b4-ijn-9-1919" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b6-ijn-9-1919" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> They have also been proposed for the enhancement of magnetic resonance imaging contrast in cancer detection,<xref rid="b7-ijn-9-1919" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> which could be coupled with localized hyperthermia treatments in the so-called theragnostic approach.<xref rid="b8-ijn-9-1919" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="b9-ijn-9-1919" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> Despite these potential advantages, only a relatively small number of nanoparticles with iron cores have been approved for clinical use.<xref rid="b10-ijn-9-1919" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="b11-ijn-9-1919" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> In 1996, the US Food and Drug Administration approved ferumoxides as the first nanoparticle-based iron oxide imaging agents for the detection of liver lesions.

The Prussian blue dye contained 10% potassium ferrocyanide and 20% hydrochloric acid, and was carried out on sections according to the protocol indicated by IHC World (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ihcworld.com">http://www.ihcworld.com</ext-link>).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Statistical analysis of the differences between values of treated and untreated samples was performed by unpaired Student&#x02019;s <italic>t</italic>-test.

The observations after Prussian blue staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1-ijn-9-1919">Figure 1A</xref>) showed that Balb/3T3 fibroblasts internalized the iron oxide nanoparticles and the flow-cytometric light-scatter data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1-ijn-9-1919">Figure 1B</xref>), confirming a trend of increased uptake at increasing exposure concentrations. Only at the highest-tested concentration did the uptake appear to increase between 24 and 48 hours of exposure, suggesting that mechanisms of uptake could be dynamic and influenced by the ferrofluid concentration itself. The results of the MTT assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2-ijn-9-1919">Figure 2A</xref>) showed that cell viability was significantly decreased at the ferrofluid concentrations of 50 and 100 &#x003bc;g/mL, with a dose-dependent response, not significantly different between 24- and 48-hour exposures. Therefore, apparently, the further nanoparticle uptake detected between 24- and 48-hour exposures to 100 &#x003bc;g/mL did not aggravate the cytotoxicity induced by 24-hour exposure. As expected, the positive control treatment with H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> induced a marked reduction of cell viability at both treatment times. The CFA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2-ijn-9-1919">Figure 2B</xref>) showed that cell proliferation was significantly and dose-dependently impaired starting from the 20 &#x003bc;g/mL concentration. The higher CFA sensitivity could be partly due to longer exposure (72 hour), but it should be noted that even when the treatment time was the same, the CFA was shown to be more sensitive than the MTT assay.<xref rid="b34-ijn-9-1919" ref-type="bibr">34</xref> The use of a battery of tests to evaluate the in vitro cytotoxicity of engineered nanoparticles has been endorsed.<xref rid="b22-ijn-9-1919" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> The combination of MTT and CFA, which evaluate cell survival by different endpoints, namely metabolic competence and proliferating capacity, is particularly suitable.</p></sec><sec><title>In vivo biodistribution and toxicity assessment</title><p>After intravenous injection of the ferrofluid, the behavior of all the animals was normal over the entire observation period, suggesting that the nanoparticles did not induce overt in vivo toxicity. To obtain a quantitative dosage of nanoparticle uptake in different organs, the manganese concentrations in liver, spleen, kidneys, and brain at 6 hours, 24 hours, 7 days, and 21 days after intravenous injection were analyzed using ICP-MS.</p><p>In the liver (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3-ijn-9-1919">Figure 3A</xref>), manganese levels peaked at 6 hours, showing a fivefold average increase compared to vehicle-treated mice (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.0001). After 24 hours, a reduction of the peak down to 50% of the level measured at 6 hours was observed; then, the manganese levels gradually declined over the next 3 weeks. However, at all data points analyzed, manganese levels remained significantly higher than in the vehicle-treated mice, suggesting that more than 3 weeks is required for the liver to completely get rid of the nanoparticles.</p><p>Prussian blue staining of histological sections was used to visually confirm ICP-MS data and to observe the tissue distribution of nanoparticles within a given organ. Prussian blue-stained liver sections (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3-ijn-9-1919">Figure 3B</xref>) indicated that at 6 hours, the manganese ferrite nanoparticles were located in the liver sinusoids and the greatest quantity had already passed through the layer of endothelial cells. After 24 hours, virtually the totality of iron particles were phagocytosed by Kupffer cells inside the sinusoids. At longer experimental times (7 and 21 days), only a small number of Kupffer cells still retained iron particles, in agreement with the kinetics based on manganese quantitative ICP-MS data. As expected, Prussian blue staining was undetectable in liver sections of vehicle-treated mice. From a histological point of view, liver sections from mice killed 6 hours after treatment with ferrofluid solution showed hydropic swelling of hepatocytes compared with their vehicle-treated counterparts. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3-ijn-9-1919">Figure 3C</xref>, hepatocytes, particularly around the central vein, were characterized by a large pale cytoplasm, containing small clear vacuoles, and a normally located nucleus. After 24 hours, the cellular swelling was already almost completely resolved, and at both the 7- and 21-day experimental points, no differences were observed between treated and vehicle-treated mouse livers. No change in cell morphology reflecting cell death (ie, apoptosis or necrosis) was observed at any examined experimental time. This pattern is typical of an acute, entirely reversible nonlethal cell injury.</p><p>In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4-ijn-9-1919">Figure 4A</xref>, the biodistribution of manganese in the kidneys shows comparable kinetics to that observed in the liver, with a maximum peak measured after 6 hours and a halving of the amount after 24 hours. At longer experimental times, no statistically significant difference was observed in the manganese levels compared to the vehicle-treated mice. The Prussian blue staining of kidney sections (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4-ijn-9-1919">Figure 4B</xref>) showed an expected absence of iron in the control group. On the contrary, cells were clearly labeled at both 6 and 24 hours after injection. Of note, despite the absence of iron labeling in the glomeruli at both experimental times, translocation phenomena were observed, with iron loading cortical tubules at 6 hours and exclusively medullary tubules at 24 hours. This biodistribution strongly supports the hypothesis of a rapid renal clearance, although it cannot be excluded that a quantity of nanoparticles may have undergone proximal tubule reabsorption. Microscopic examination of kidney sections did not show any apparent change in the cellular and tissue architecture compared to tissue from vehicle-treated mice.</p><p>The quantitative analyses of manganese levels carried out in the spleen and brain showed a statistically significant increase of this metal after 6 and 24 hours after injection, with complete recovery of basal levels at the longer experimental times (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5-ijn-9-1919">Figure 5A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5-ijn-9-1919">B</xref>). Due to the high quantity of iron normally present in the spleen and the very low levels of metal in the brain after injection, no information was extrapolated after Prussian blue staining in either organ. Anyway, from the histopathological point of view, no significant change was observed at any experimental time. Representative images of spleen and brain sections from mice killed 6 hours after treatment with ferrofluid solution compared to vehicle-treated mice are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5-ijn-9-1919">Figure 5C</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5-ijn-9-1919">F</xref>.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Biodistribution and toxicity assessment are critical for the development of nanoparticle-based drugs, because of nanoparticle-enhanced biological reactivity.<xref rid="b35-ijn-9-1919" ref-type="bibr">35</xref> This study was undertaken to investigate the potential of a newly synthesized manganese iron oxide nanofluid for biomedical applications. The analysis of biodistribution demonstrated that after intravenous injection, the ferrofluid was taken up by different organs. Of note, the detection of ferrofluid in the brain showed that it crossed the blood&#x02013;brain barrier, a critical limit for nanoparticle-based drug application. The safety assessment excluded irreversible organ toxicity in vivo up to 21 days after a single injection, confirming the biocompatibility of our formulation and supporting its potential use for magnetic resonance imaging contrast and targeted therapy. As usually recommended, parallel in vitro experiments were carried out under high-dose, long-term exposure conditions, not necessarily representative of likely in vivo exposure, to characterize the general level of toxicity of the test item. These experiments showed a dose-dependent reduction of cell viability starting from a concentration of 20 &#x003bc;g/mL. It is not uncommon that even when something is found to be toxic in vitro, it may not be so in vivo, and an overall biosafety assessment of the ferrofluid requires in vitro and in vivo results to be weighed up in terms of dose comparison. To compare in vitro and in vivo treatment doses, it can be roughly assumed that 1 kg body weight is equal to 1 L of culture medium. Therefore, our in vivo dose of 150 &#x003bc;mol/kg of Fe was about five times lower than the maximum-tested in vitro concentration (100 &#x003bc;g/mL of MnFe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>, 700 &#x003bc;mol/L of Fe) and close to the lowest concentration (20 &#x003bc;g/mL of MnFe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>, 140 &#x003bc;mol/L of Fe), eliciting some reduction in Balb/3T3 cell-proliferation capacity. Considering that i) our tested in vivo dose was about ten times higher than that currently used in clinical practice with other ferrofluid nanoformulations, and ii) in vitro toxicity was induced under 24&#x02013;72 hours of continuous exposure, our results suggest that there might still be a sufficient safety margin for further development of our formulation. However, further studies are warranted to investigate mechanistic toxicity pathways and to evaluate in vivo toxicity of repeated injections to explore a prospective therapeutic application of the ferrofluid.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>The authors are indebted to Drs Marco Vittori Antisari, Carmela Marino, Anna Saran, Eugenio Benvenuto, and Dario Della Sala for endorsing the research aims, and the staff efforts to achieve them.
