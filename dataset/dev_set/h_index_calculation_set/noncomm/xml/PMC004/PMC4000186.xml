The novel nano- to micro-structured biodegradable hybrid fibers were prepared by electrospinning. The characteristics of the hybrid membranes were investigated by a range of methods, including Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, and differential scanning calorimetry. Morphological study with scanning electron microscopy showed that the average fiber diameter and the number of nanoscale pores on each individual fiber surface decreased with increasing concentration of poly(&#x003b5;-caprolactone)-poly(ethylene glycol)-poly(&#x003b5;-caprolactone) (PCEC). The prepared polylactide (PLA)/PCEC fibrous membranes favored hPMSC attachment and proliferation by providing an interconnected, porous, three-dimensional mimicked extracellular environment. What is more, hPMSCs cultured on the electrospun hybrid PLA/PCEC fibrous scaffolds could be effectively differentiated into bone-associated cells by positive alizarin red staining. Given the good cellular response and excellent osteogenic potential in vitro, the electrospun PLA/PCEC fibrous scaffolds could be one of the most promising candidates for bone tissue engineering.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Keywords</title><kwd>electrospinning</kwd><kwd>PLA</kwd><kwd>PCEC</kwd><kwd>hPMSCs</kwd><kwd>bone tissue engineering</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Critical-size bone defects remain a major health care issue due to the difficulties in reconstructing large bone segments, and are caused by various diseases, such as trauma, abnormalities, congenital deficiency, or carcinological resection.<xref rid="b1-ijn-9-1991" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="b2-ijn-9-1991" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> The recent gold standard for treatment remains bone grafting with autologous or allogeneic bone graft.

The <sup>1</sup>H-NMR and GPC results indicate that the PCEC block copolymers were prepared successfully, with a controlled macromolecular weight (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2-ijn-9-1991">Figure 2B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3-ijn-9-1991">C</xref>). The results presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3-ijn-9-1991">Figure 3A</xref> reveal that PCEC copolymer exhibited characteristic bands of both PCL and PEG segments, which confirmed the formation of PCEC copolymer. PLA/PCEC hybrid scaffolds exhibited characteristic bands of PLA and PCEC that indicated that the two polymers were blended together when dissolve in dichloromethane together. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3-ijn-9-1991">Figure 3B</xref>, PLA is seen to be a type of semi-crystalline polyester polymer; however, in the process of forming the pattern of pure PLA membrane, no characteristic diffraction peaks occurred, which confirmed that the polymer matrix kept an amorphous structure, while the pattern of pure PCEC membrane revealed that PCEC had a crystalline pattern. Moreover, in the pattern of hybrid membranes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3-ijn-9-1991">Figure 3Bc</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3-ijn-9-1991">d</xref>), peaks at 17.1&#x000b0; and 16.7&#x000b0; could be detected, which indicate that the PLA of PLA/PCEC hybrid membranes were no longer in an amorphous state, but converted into crystalline material.</p><p>As seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4-ijn-9-1991">Figure 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="t1-ijn-9-1991">Table 1</xref>, the two melting temperatures of PLA/PCEC fibrous scaffolds were higher than those of pure PCEC. The reason might be that interactions between PLA and PCEC after incorporation of PCEC into PLA polymer when electrospun into fibers; however, the sample containing 25 wt% PCEC had a higher crystallization temperature, at 30.5&#x000b0;C, probably because of the homogeneous nucleation effect of PCEC on the cold crystallization of PLA matrix. From the thermogravimetric analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5-ijn-9-1991">Figure 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="t1-ijn-9-1991">Table 1</xref>), the temperature at which 5% decomposition increase might have been because of the increasing of crystallinity when PCEC concentration was increased. All of those results have proved that thermal stability of PLA/PCEC hybrid membrane was better than that of pure PLA and pure PCEC membrane.</p><p>Morphology of the scaffolds was examined by SEM, and images are presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6-ijn-9-1991">Figure 6</xref>. For pure PLA, there were some spindle-shaped structures among the fibers, and the electrospinning process was not very smooth. This might be due to the intrinsic properties of PLA solution, such as surface tension and viscosity.<xref rid="b44-ijn-9-1991" ref-type="bibr">44</xref> Interestingly, the electrospun fiber surface of PLA exhibited nanoscale pores, as also reported by Bognitzki et al, who rationalized that the rapid phase separation induced by the evaporation of the solvent and the subsequent rapid solidification during electrospinning might have accounted for this surface structure.<xref rid="b22-ijn-9-1991" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> With increasing PCEC concentration, the process of electrospinning became smooth, with no spindle-shaped structures formed. We suspected that the low molecular weight (compared with the PLA) might affect the intrinsic properties of the hybrid solution, and PCEC might play the role of lubricant in the mixed solutions, which could reduce the solution viscosity. However, PLA/PCEC with 75 wt% concentration of PCEC could not turn into homogeneous fiber, and numerous beaded structures formed through electrospinning. We speculated that phase separation might be the main reason, which led to formation of amorphous PLA-rich and PCEC-rich phases. The water contact angle of PLA/PCEC hybrid scaffolds was found to gradually decrease from 126.5&#x000b0; to 93.9&#x000b0; with increasing PCEC concentration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7-ijn-9-1991">Figure 7</xref>), which might have been due to the increasing number of hydrophilic phases of PEG and good distribution of fibers.</p><p>Mechanical properties, as importance factor of three-dimensional nanoporous scaffolds, were investigated in this study. Based on the results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f8-ijn-9-1991">Figure 8</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="t2-ijn-9-1991">Table 2</xref>), the sample containing 25 wt% PCEC showed the highest elongation rate at break, while the sample containing 50 wt% PCEC displayed highest tensile strength of all the samples. The results of tensile testing demonstrated that PCEC concentration had a great effect on mechanical properties of the samples. Some reports in the literature have reported that ABA triblock copolymer, such as PCEC used in this study, could modify the mechanical properties. The reason might be ABA triblock copolymer show capable of forming a stereocomplex with the PLA matrix, which was used as the sole strengthening agent to modify the physical strength of PLA.<xref rid="b44-ijn-9-1991" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>,<xref rid="b45-ijn-9-1991" ref-type="bibr">45</xref> On the other hand, we speculated that the increase of fiber crystallinity might play an effective role in improvement of mechanical properties of PLA/PCEC hybrid scaffolds.</p><p>To validate the cell response of PLA/PCEC hybrid scaffolds, the behavior of hPMSCs cultured on the scaffolds was observed. We evaluated cells&#x02019; metabolic activity and viability by MTT assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f9-ijn-9-1991">Figure 9D</xref>), cell morphology and cell interaction with the hybrid scaffolds by fluorescent microscopic images (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f9-ijn-9-1991">Figure 9A</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f9-ijn-9-1991">C</xref>), and cell differential ability by SEM and alizarin red staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f10-ijn-9-1991">Figure 10</xref>). The results revealed that hPMSCs interacted and integrated well with surrounding fibers, and could proliferate and spread well on the membranes. Moreover, after 2 weeks&#x02019; incubation in osteogenic differential medium, the hPMSCs cultured on PLA/PCEC fibrous scaffolds clearly showed matrix mineralization with alizarin red staining. On the whole, the PLA/PCEC electrospun scaffolds showed good cellular compatibility and favorable osteogenic potential in vitro, thus should be suitable candidates for application in bone tissue engineering.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>In this study, PLA blending with different concentrations of ABA triblock copolymer PCEC were electrospun into nano-to microfibers, with numerous nanopores on the surface of a single fiber, and they exhibited improvement of morphology and mechanical properties compared to neat PLA fiber membrane. With the ratio of PCEC increasing from 0% to 50%, average diameter of fiber and water contact angle of membrane decreased, while mechanical properties and thermal characteristics clearly improved. The biocompatibility of the scaffolds to hPMSCs was demonstrated by MTT. Favorable interactions between hPMSCs on the scaffolds were demonstrated by cell morphology, proliferation, and differentiation studies. These results definitely prove the potential of these scaffolds for bone tissue engineering. In our further research, the mechanism of triblock copolymer improving PLA mechanical properties will be studied, and this type of bone tissue substitute will be explored in vivo.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>This work was financially supported by National Natural Sciences Foundation of China (81372446), National S&#x00026;T Major Project (2011ZX09102-001-10 and 2013ZX09301304-007), and Sichuan Provincial Science and Technology Department Support Project (2011SZ0222).
