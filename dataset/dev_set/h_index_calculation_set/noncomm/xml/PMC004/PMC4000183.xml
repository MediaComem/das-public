The efficiency and safety of PPTT can be improved by functionally modifying the gold nanorods with proteins or biomolecules. In this study, AuNRs were modified with anti-epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) monoclonal antibody (mAb), and the apoptotic potential of EGFRmAb-AuNR was assessed in Hep-2 cells in vitro and in vivo. The EGFRmAb modification had no obvious influence on the original optical property of the AuNRs, but it significantly increased the entry of AuNRs into Hep-2 cells. EGFRmAb-AuNRs, with appropriate laser irradiation, resulted in higher Hep-2 cells apoptosis than AuNRs did alone, in vitro, and was accompanied by alteration of reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, Ca<sup>2+</sup> release, change in mitochondrial membrane potential (&#x00394;&#x003a8;m), cytochrome c (Cyt-c) release, active caspase-3 expression, and level of B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2) and B-cell lymphoma 2 protein-associated X protein (Bax). EGFRmAb-AuNR-mediated apoptosis in Hep-2 cells was also observed in vivo and had an inhibitive effect on growth of Hep-2 tumor xenografts. Our data suggest that the EGFRmAb modification improves AuNR-mediated apoptosis and may have the potential to be used clinically.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Keywords</title><kwd>AuNRs</kwd><kwd>laryngeal squamous cancer cells</kwd><kwd>plasmonic photothermal therapy</kwd><kwd>PPTT</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Nano technology has been widely used in biomedical research in recent years. Gold nanorods (AuNRs) are a nontoxic nonmaterial and are thought to be a promising tool for use in clinical diagnosis and treatment of diseases.<xref rid="b1-ijn-9-1931" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="b2-ijn-9-1931" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> AuNRs have a characteristic surface plasmon resonance,<xref rid="b2-ijn-9-1931" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b5-ijn-9-1931" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> with two distinctive absorption peaks: a longitudinal plasmon absorption peak and transverse plasmon peak (at around 520 nm). The longitudinal plasmon peak locates in the far-red and near-infrared (NIR) region of the electromagnetic spectrum. In these regions, living tissues could be well penetrated by light located in far-red and near-infrared (NIR) region of the electromagnetic spectrum. In addition, the longitudinal plasmon peak can be altered by modifying the structure of the AuNRs, without changing the transverse plasmon peak. Due to the phenomenon of surface plasmon resonance, AuNRs have a higher light absorption in the NIR region than do conventional laser phototherapy agents. High light absorption in the NIR region is very important in photothermal therapy as it has the deepest penetration in tissue (known as &#x0201c;tissue optical window&#x0201d;).<xref rid="b6-ijn-9-1931" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> The gold nanospheres and gold nanoshells have shown a strong absorption in NIR, when their size and thickness, respectively, were controlled.<xref rid="b4-ijn-9-1931" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="b7-ijn-9-1931" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> Spheres with a diameter of 30 nm were found to be optimal for intracellular uptake.<xref rid="b8-ijn-9-1931" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> Therefore, the AuNRs (49.81 nm at length and 12.70 nm in diameter) described in this study are better than gold nanospheres and gold nanoshells with a larger size, as the bigger size of the nanospheres/nanoshells will reduce intracellular uptake of gold nanospheres or gold nanoshells. The light absorbed by AuNRs can subsequently convert into heat.<xref rid="b2-ijn-9-1931" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="b3-ijn-9-1931" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> Therefore, AuNRs have a great potential to be used in plasmonic photothermal therapy.</p><p>In the descriptions by Wang et al,<xref rid="b9-ijn-9-1931" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> AuNRs had a quick clearance in blood, and long-term retention of AuNRs were found in the reticuloendothelial system, in tissues such as liver, spleen, and kidney.

AuNRs enter into cells by diffusion. The entry of EGFRmAb-AuNRs into cells is mainly dependent on endocytosis, mediated by the binding between the conjugated EGFR antibody and EGFR on the cell membrane. EGFR expression varies among different cellular types. The method used to conjugate EGFRmAb onto the AuNRs influences the binding efficiency between the EGFRmAb-AuNR and EGFR.<xref rid="b1-ijn-9-1931" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> Thus, the effects of EGFRmAb-AuNRs might vary in different studies due to the above factors.</p><p>Laryngeal cancer is one of the most malignant tumors of the head and neck.<xref rid="b26-ijn-9-1931" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="b27-ijn-9-1931" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> Laryngeal squamous cell cancer (LSCC) is the most common type of laryngeal cancer.

To prepare the EGFRmAb-AuNRs conjugates, a 250 &#x003bc;L colloidal solution (0.4 nmol/L) of poly(sodium 4-styrenesulfonate)-modified AuNRs and 1 &#x003bc;L (25.7 mg/mL) EGFRmAb (Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, MO, USA) were mixed and oscillated for 30 minutes. Then, the solution was centrifuged for 10 minutes at 12,000 rpm, and the sediments of EGFRmAb-AuNR conjugate were dissolved with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). The synthetic AuNRs (0.1 nmol/L) were observed under transmission electron microscope (TEM) (JEM 1010; JEOL Ltd, Tokyo, Japan) to determine the mean value of the long and transverse diameter of the AuNRs. The absorption spectra of the AuNRs and EGFRmAb-AuNRs were determined by using ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis)-NIR spectrometer (Lambda 900; PerkinElmer Inc., Waltham, MA, USA). A diode laser K81S09F (WT Beijing Ltd, Beijing, People&#x02019;s Republic China), at 808 nm, was used for the laser irradiation experiment. The red laser, at 808 nm, was focused to a 1 mm diameter spot on the sample.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Cell culture, TEM, and inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy element analysis</title><p>Hep-2 cells were cultured in Dulbecco&#x02019;s Modified Eagle&#x02019;s Medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin-streptomycin (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA), at 37&#x000b0;C with a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO<sub>2</sub>. For the TEM analysis, Hep-2 cells were incubated with 0.1 nmol/L AuNRs or 0.1 nmol/L EGFRmAb-AuNRs for 6 hours before collection. Hep-2 cells were also treated with the combination of AuNRs plus laser (AuNRs+Laser) or EGFRmAb-AuNRs plus laser (EGFRmAb-AuNRs+Laser), and at 24 hours after the laser treatment, the irradiated cells were collected for the analysis. Cells were collected by 800 rpm centrifugation and fixed with 3.5% glutaraldehyde. The fixed cells were examined under TEM (JEM-1010, JEOL Company, Japan). Similarly, cells were incubated with 0.1 nmol/L AuNRs or 0.1 nmol/L EGFRmAb-AuNRs for 6 hours before the element analysis using inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES) (Lambda900). A 3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay was used to analyze Hep-2 cell proliferation under different stimuli. The EGFR-expression of Hep-2 cells and LSCC patient samples were examined by western blot. The samples (n=36) of LSCC and adjacent tissue, and of normal laryngeal tissues (n=13) were collected from the First and the Third Affiliated Hospital of Kunming Medical University. The ethics committee of Kunming Medical University approved this study in using human and mouse tissues.</p></sec><sec><title>Western blot</title><p>The whole-cell or whole-tissue lysate were prepared using protein lysis buffer (Beyotime, P0013).

The membrane was incubated with the solution of diluted primary antibodies (1:000 v/v) overnight at 4&#x000b0;C. Subsequently, the membrane was incubated with the peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit (KPL, 474-1506, 1:5000) immunoglobulin G for 1 hour at room temperature. The enhanced chemiluminescence western blot detection kit (Millipore, WBKLS0500) was used to detect the epitope.</p></sec><sec><title>Apoptosis assay</title><p>Hep-2 cells were cultured in 24-well plates and treated with 0.1 nmol/L AuNRs or 0.1 nmol/L EGFRmAb-AuNRs for 6 hours before the irradiation. The irradiated cells were collected at 0 hours, 24 hours, 48 hours, and 72 hours postirradiation. The collected cells were fixed with 3.5% glutaraldehyde. Apoptosis was analyzed using two methods: TEM and flow cytometry (FCM). TEM was used to observe the ultrastructure of the tumor cells. Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL)/Propidium Iodide (PI) FCM was the method used to determine the apoptosis and cell cycle distribution of the treated Hep-2 cells. Cells were harvested using a trypsin/ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid mixture, and then, cells (1 &#x000d7; 10<sup>6</sup>) were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 30 minutes at 4&#x000b0;C. After that, cells were washed twice with PBS and then, fixed with 70% ethanol overnight at &#x02212;20&#x000b0;C. Cells were then rehydrated and stained with TUNEL Label Mix (F. Hoffman-La Roche Ltd, Basel, Switzerland) for 60 minutes at 37&#x000b0;C in a humidified atmosphere, in darkness. Cells were then washed with PBS and treated with 100 U/mL RNase (R6148, Sigma-Aldrich) containing 0.002% Triton&#x02122; X 100 (Sigma-Aldrich) for 15 minutes before staining with PI (final concentration 50 &#x003bc;g/mL) (cIEF pI Marker Kit; Beckman Coulter Inc., Brea, CA, USA) for 20 minutes. The treated cells were then analyzed by FACScan (Coulter<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> Epics<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> XL&#x02122; Flow Cytometer; Beckman Coulter Inc.). For the FACScan analysis of xenograft tumor cells, tumors in nude mice were excised and homogenized in lysis buffer (RIPA Lysis Buffer System/sc-24948; Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc., Dallas, TX, USA) by grinding with a pestle. The homogenates were then passed through a 70 &#x003bc;M cell strainer to get single-cell suspensions, which were then analyzed by the previously described TUNEL/PI FCM method. Meanwhile, FCM was used to analyze other apoptotic molecules, including cytochrome c (Cyt-c) (CBA077 InnoCyte&#x02122; Flow Cytometric Cytochrome c Release Kit/CBA077-1KIT; EMD Millipore), change in mitochondrial membrane potential (&#x00394;&#x003a8;m) (Mitochondria staining kit (JC-1)/125T; MultiSciences Biotech Company, People&#x02019;s Republic of China), B-cell lymphoma 2 protein (Bcl-2) (Bcl2 Mouse Anti-Human mAb [clone Bcl2/100]), FITC conjugate/A15764; Life Technologies), Bcl-2-associated X protein (Bax) (LifeSpan BioSciences Inc.), Ca<sup>2+</sup> (Calcium Green&#x02122;-1/C-3012; Life Technologies), reactive oxygen species (ROS) (Reactive Oxygen Species Assay Kit/S0033; Beyotime Co, Jiangsu, People&#x02019;s Republic of China) and caspase-3 (BD Biosciences, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA).</p></sec><sec><title>Xenograft model of Hep-2 cells</title><p>BALB/C nude mice (average weight 17&#x02013;22 g, age 5&#x02013;6 weeks) were purchased from Vital River Laboratories (Beijing, People&#x02019;s Republic of China) and housed with sterile food and water. Nude mice received subcutaneous injection with tumor cells (2 &#x000d7; 10<sup>7</sup>/mL). The palpable tumors were typically observed about 1 week after the injection of Hep-2 tumor cells. When the mean tumor volumes were 100&#x0223c;200 mm<sup>3</sup>, treatments were initiated. This consisted of 0.9% NaCl, AuNRs, or EGFRmAb-AuNRs injected through the tail vein. The injected dose of AuNRs in the AuNR group or EGFRmAb-AuNR group was 560 &#x003bc;g/kg. The dosage for the in vivo study was fixed by referring to the description by Wang et al.<xref rid="b9-ijn-9-1931" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> In that study, Sprague Dawley rats were injected intravenously with AuNRs at a dose of 560 &#x003bc;g/kg.

Cisplatin (5 mg/kg) was administered by intraperitoneal injection twice a week (day 1 and day 3). An NIR laser was used to irradiate the tumor with a wavelength of 808 nm. The irradiation power was 3.0 W/cm<sup>2</sup>, and the irradiation time was 8 minutes. After 2 weeks, mice in different treatment groups were euthanized, and tumor tissues were collected.

The particle size of the AuNRs was uniform (49.81 nm in length and 12.70 nm in diameter), the aspect ratio was 3.92. UV-vis-NIR spectrometer analysis showed that 0.1 nmol/L AuNRs had two resonance absorption peaks: a transverse peak at 510 nm and a longitudinal peak at 800 nm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1-ijn-9-1931">Figure 1A</xref>).

In the experiments described below, Hep-2 cells were treated with AuNRs or EGFRmAb-AuNRs for 6 hours before subsequent treatments. The treatment with AuNRs did not obviously change cellular shape and cellular structure. ICP-AES element analysis showed that the number of AuNRs in cells modified by EFGRmAb was more than that with nonmodification (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1-ijn-9-1931">Figure 1D</xref>). We also found that EGFRmAb-AuNRs accumulated on the membrane of Hep-2 cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-ijn-9-1931">Figure S1</xref>). The result indicated that the EGFRmAb-AuNRs targeted the EGFR-expressing tumor cells. Generally, the EGFRmAb modification allowed more AuNRs to enter Hep-2 cells.</p><p>The room temperature in our lab was maintained at 23&#x000b0;C in this study. We irradiated 0.1 nmol/L AuNRs with a diode laser (808 nm) at various power densities (0&#x02013;5 W/cm<sup>2</sup>). During the continuous irradiation, the solutions&#x02019; temperature quickly rose at the beginning and then became stable. We found 3 W/cm<sup>2</sup> laser irradiation resulted in a solution temperature that rose and stabilized at 46&#x000b0;C. In our experiment, cells treated with AuNRs or EGFRmAb-AuNRs were also irradiated with 3 W/cm<sup>2</sup> laser for 8 minutes (46&#x000b0;C). The irradiated cells were stained with 0.4% trypan blue, and about 70%~80% cells were stained blue (indicating they were dead).

NIR laser irradiation caused a quick temperature rise in the solution of AuNRs or EGFRmAb-AuNRs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2-ijn-9-1931">Figure 2B</xref>). The cytotoxic effect of EGFRmAb-AuNRs was evaluated in Beas-2B cells (human bronchial epithelial cells) and Hep-2 cells. The Beas-2B cells and Hep-2 cells were treated with various doses of EGFR-AuNRs or 0.1 AuNRs for 72 hours. The results of the MTT assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2-ijn-9-1931">Figure 2C</xref>) showed that 0.1 nmol/L EGFRmAb-AuNRs or AuNRs had little cytotoxicity to Beas-2B cells and Hep-2 cells.</p></sec><sec><title>Effects of EGFRmAb-AuNRs on apoptosis</title><p>To determine whether the Hep-2 cells growth inhibition mediated by AuNRs or EGFRmAb-AuNRs was associated with apoptosis, TEM and FCM were used. The results of the TEM showed obvious Hep-2 cell apoptosis after irradiation for 48 hours in the AuNRs+Laser group and EGFRmAb-AuNRs+Laser group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3-ijn-9-1931">Figure 3A</xref>). In the AuNRs+Laser group, cell shrinkage, chromatin condensation along the nuclear membrane, membrane blebbing, and formations of apoptotic bodies could be found (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3-ijn-9-1931">Figure 3A</xref>, left panel). In the EGFRmAb-AuNRs+Laser group, cell shrinkage, nuclear fragmentation, and chromatin condensation along the nuclear membrane could be found (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3-ijn-9-1931">Figure 3A</xref>, right panel). TEM images from both groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3-ijn-9-1931">Figure 3A</xref>) showed the characteristic morphological and ultrastructural changes of apoptosis. In the FCM analysis, the apoptosis rate of the EGFRmAb-AuNRs+Laser group (~50% at 48 hours and ~73% at 72 hours) was higher than that of the AuNRs+Laser group (~32% at 48 hours and ~52% at 72 hours) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3-ijn-9-1931">Figure 3B</xref>). In the cell cycle distribution analysis by FCM, the proportion of G0/G1 cells significantly increased to ~70% and ~80%, respectively, after treatment with AuNRs+Laser or EGFRmAb-AuNRs+Laser for 48 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3-ijn-9-1931">Figure 3C</xref>). The alteration of several apoptotic markers (caspase-3, Bax, ROS, Ca<sup>2+</sup>, &#x00394;&#x003a8;m, and Bcl-2) was shown in the EGFRmAb-AuNRs+Laser group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4-ijn-9-1931">Figure 4</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Effects of EGFRmAb-AuNRs on treatment of tumor xenograft</title><p>Xenograft tumor models of nude mice were used to analyze the treatment effects of AuNRs+Laser and EGFRmAb-AuNRs+Laser. The growth of tumor was suppressed in both treatment groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5-ijn-9-1931">Figure 5A</xref>). However, treatment with low-dose NIR laser irradiation did not suppress the tumor growth. Treatment with cisplatin served as a positive control; after treatment with cisplatin for 2 weeks, the tumor growth in nude mice was significantly suppressed. In each treatment group, six mice were used. The photos of tumor xenografts in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5-ijn-9-1931">Figure 5A</xref> were all taken at 14 days after the laser irradiation or cisplatin treatment. FCM analysis showed that the apoptosis rate in the EGFRmAb-AuNRs group (~32%) was higher than that in the AuNRs group (~10%) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5-ijn-9-1931">Figure 5B</xref>). FCM analysis of transplanted tumors in mice further confirmed that the apoptosis was induced by phototherm is of AuNRs or EGFRmAb-AuNRs in vitro. We also detected the expression of active caspase-3, Bax, and Bcl-2 in all the vitro tumors (n=6) that were collected at 14 days postirradiation. The expression alteration of active caspase-3, Bax, and Bcl-2 in the in vitro tumors showed a similar trend to that of the in vitro cellular studies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4-ijn-9-1931">Figure 4</xref>), as shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2-ijn-9-1931">Figure S2</xref>. The H&#x00026;E staining and TUNEL staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5-ijn-9-1931">Figure 5C</xref>) also supported the conclusion that EGFRmAb-AuNRs+Laser treatment induced apoptosis in transplanted Hep-2 cell tumors.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>AuNR-mediated photothermia has been shown to kill tumor cells. The therapeutic effects mediated by AuNRs are associated with size, shape, surface charge, and surface modification, which influence the effects of AuNR-intake by cells. Increasing intake of AuNRs can improve the efficiency of AuNR-mediated killing effects in tumor cells. In this study, AuNRs were modified with EGFRmAb. The EGFRmAb-AuNRs entered tumor cells to a greater extent than did AuNRs alone. Meanwhile, the possible mechanism of AuNR-mediated killing of Hep-2 cells was investigated in vitro and in vivo.</p><p>The EGFRmAb-AuNRs were characterized in our study (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1-ijn-9-1931">Figure 1</xref>). TEM showed that the AuNRs could easily enter Hep-2 cells and that AuNRs was mostly found in cellular organelles, such as lysosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1-ijn-9-1931">Figure 1C</xref>). Based on these preliminary observations, it is possible that AuNRs have a tendency to locate in particular cellular organelles but are not randomly distributed. ICP-AES element analysis showed that a greater number of EGFRmAb-AuNRs than AuNRs, entered the Hep-2 cells. Therefore, the modification of AuNRs with EGFRmAb improved the efficiency of AuNRs, entry into Hep-2 cells, which might be associated with endocytosis.<xref rid="b40-ijn-9-1931" ref-type="bibr">40</xref> Only tumor tissues were collected from the mice injected with AuNRs or EGFRmAb-AuNRs. This was a weakness of our study. The distribution of AuNRs or EGFRmAb-AuNRs is very important for the future study of their mechanisms.</p><p>The size of AuNRs in this study was 49.81 nm in length and 12.70 nm in diameter. Their aspect ratio was 3.92. The AuNRs absorbed strongly in the NIR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1-ijn-9-1931">Figure 1A</xref>). The EGFRmAb-AuNRs showed a red shift of 7&#x02013;9 nm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1-ijn-9-1931">Figure 1A</xref>). The red shift was caused by the preferential assembly of the EGFRmAb-AuNRs, and these results are consistent with other studies<xref rid="b23-ijn-9-1931" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="b41-ijn-9-1931" ref-type="bibr">41</xref> in which conjugation of AuNRs with antibodies resulted in a red shift compared with nonmodified AuNRs. EGFRmAb-AuNRs also had a strong absorption in the NIR. The EGFRmAb-AuNRs in this study are suitable for phototherapy.<xref rid="b42-ijn-9-1931" ref-type="bibr">42</xref></p><p>Cell death mediated by EGFRmAb-AuNRs+Laser treatment is closely associated with thermal production after NIR laser irradiation.<xref rid="b2-ijn-9-1931" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> In our study, the thermal production with EGFRmAb-AuNRs+Laser treatment was measured by the temperature change during the NIR laser irradiation. It is noted that the temperature of the EGFRmAb-AuNRs+Laser solution stabilized after continuous NIR irradiation for a certain time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2-ijn-9-1931">Figure 2</xref>).</p><p>The apoptotic characteristics of Hep-2 cells treated with AuNRs+Laser or EGFRmAb-AuNRs+Laser are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3-ijn-9-1931">Figure 3A</xref>. The results should be further validated by other in vivo experiments. This will provide more details of the apoptosis induced by AuNRs+Laser or EGFRmAb-AuNRs+Laser. Levels of caspase-3, Bax, ROS, Ca<sup>2+</sup>, &#x00394;&#x003a8;m, and Bcl-2 were found to be altered in EGFRmAb-AuNRs+Laser-mediated cell death (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4-ijn-9-1931">Figure 4</xref>). Caspase-3 is an important executioner of apoptosis.<xref rid="b43-ijn-9-1931" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>,<xref rid="b44-ijn-9-1931" ref-type="bibr">44</xref> Active caspase-3 expression increased with EGFRmAb-AuNRs+Laser treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4-ijn-9-1931">Figure 4D</xref>). This result suggested that the EGFRmAb-AuNRs+Laser treatment induced Hep-2 cell apoptosis. &#x00394;&#x003a8;m decrease, Bax-expression increase, Bcl-2-expression decrease, and ROS increase were all detected in the EGFRmAb-AuNRs+Laser treatment group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4-ijn-9-1931">Figure 4D</xref>). The result suggested that the apoptosis with EGFRmAb-AuNRs+Laser was mitochondria-dependent. In the study by Rejiya et al, the combination of EGFRmAb-AuNRs with laser induced A431 cell apoptosis accompanied with ROS increase, &#x00394;&#x003a8;m decrease, and activation of caspase-3.<xref rid="b23-ijn-9-1931" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> Our findings are consistent with their results. ROS production has been found to be an &#x0201c;inducer&#x0201d; that can activate the subsequent apoptotic and antiapoptotic factors.<xref rid="b45-ijn-9-1931" ref-type="bibr">45</xref> ROS production was seen earlier than alterations of the other apoptotic markers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4-ijn-9-1931">Figure 4</xref>). The data suggested that the apoptosis induced by EGFRmAb-AuNRs was ROS-dependent, and that ROS generation might be required for subsequent activations of apoptotic factors, like caspase-3. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4-ijn-9-1931">Figure 4B</xref>, active caspase-3-expression started at 24 hours after laser irradiation, which was generally consistent with the increase of Bcl-2 expression. In vivo experiments showed that EGFRmAb-AuNRs had therapeutic effects on Hep-2 transplant tumor in vivo, and this therapeutic effect was dependent on apoptosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5-ijn-9-1931">Figure 5</xref>). Furthermore, the apoptosis mediated by EGFRmAb-AuNRs+Laser was greater than that by the AuNRs in vitro and in vivo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5-ijn-9-1931">Figure 5</xref>).</p><p>In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2-ijn-9-1931">Figure 2A</xref>, there was not a significant difference in growth inhibition between the bare AuNR group and the EGFRmAb-AuNR group. However, in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3-ijn-9-1931">Figure 3B</xref>, the overall cell death (ie, apoptosis plus necrosis [~75%]) induced by EGFRmAb-AuNRs was higher than that induced by the AuNRs (~55%). From the data, it is likely that the cell death modes induced by AuNRs or EGFRmAb-AuNRs were different between the groups of AuNRs and EGFRmAb-AuNRs. Recent studies have demonstrated that autophagy is associated with hyperthermia.<xref rid="b46-ijn-9-1931" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b48-ijn-9-1931" ref-type="bibr">48</xref> Some TEM images showed that there were a higher number of autophagic structures (vacuolar components and secondary lysosomes) in the AuNRs+Laser group than in the EGFRmAb-AuNRs+Laser group (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3-ijn-9-1931">Figure S3</xref>). Therefore, it is possible that the low overall cell death (apoptosis plus necrosis) in the AuNRs group was related to other modes of cell death, such as autophagy. The above speculations need further examination as our data is too limited to draw firm conclusions.</p><p>Since the photothermolysis with AuNRs or EGFRmAb-AuNRs in our study was shown to be effective in killing Hep-2 cells, understanding the exact cellular location of AuNRs or EGFRmAb-AuNRs will be very important for the investigation of the mechanism of cell death induced by AuNRs or EGFRmAb-AuNRs. Therefore, in future study, the cellular location of AuNRs or EGFRmAb-AuNRs should be determined by various techniques, like fluorescence microscopy, with ICP determination of the gold content in cellular organelles.</p><p>The Hep-2 cell is a human LSCC line that expresses EGFR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1-ijn-9-1931">Figure 1B</xref>). In our study, the cellular uptake of AuNRs with the EGFRmAb-AuNRs group was significantly higher than that with AuNRs group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1-ijn-9-1931">Figure 1D</xref>). The result suggested that EGFRmAb-AuNRs specifically targeted Hep-2 cells that expressed EGFR. Our results from the xenograft model of Hep-2 cells showed that tumor growth suppression or apoptosis induced by treatment with EGFRmAb-AuNRs+Laser was significantly higher than that induced by AuNRs+Laser (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5-ijn-9-1931">Figure 5</xref>). Therefore, EGFRmAb-AuNRs have the potential to be used in LSCC-targeted therapy, especially for the LSCC patients that have high levels of EGFR expression. The results also suggested that EGFRmAb-AuNRs could possibly be given through intravenous injection in clinical trials before giving laser treatment. It should be noted that the long- and short-term toxicity of EGFRmAb-AuNRs is still unclear and should be carefully examined before using clinically. Generally, our study showed the possibility of treating LSCC using EGFRmAb-AuNRs. Further studies are needed to give more guidance on how to use appropriately in the clinical treatment of LSCC.</p><p>Traditional chemotherapy (eg, cisplatin) has been found clinically to have therapeutic effects on tumors. However, chemotherapy drugs do not only kill cancer cells but also kill normal cells. Therefore, chemotherapy can cause side effects, such as renal toxicity. Radiotherapy can cause damage to the tumor. At the same time, it also damages the surrounding normal tissue. In this regard, photothermal therapy mediated by EGFRmAb-AuNRs is better than the traditional chemotherapy or radiotherapy. EGFRmAb-AuNRs can specifically target Hep-2 cells (cancer cells), yet will only kill Hep-2 cells and has no influence on normal cells. Furthermore, EGFRmAb-AuNRs showed little toxicity in vitro and in vivo.</p><p>In this study, the potential of EGFRmAb-AuNRs in cancer treatment was evaluated using Hep-2 cells. The in vitro and in vivo results showed that the photothermolysis mediated by combination of EGFRmAb-AuNRs and NIR irradiation could effectively kill Hep-2 cells, and the cell death was mainly caused by apoptosis. Generally, EGFRmAb-AuNRs have the potential to be used in cancer treatment, and more studies are needed.</p><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1-ijn-9-1931"><label>Figure S1</label><caption><p>TEM images of Hep-2 cells incubated with 0.1nmol/L EGFRmAb-AuNRs for 30 minutes.
