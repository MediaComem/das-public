Introduction</title><p>Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a debilitating and lethal neuromuscular disorder. Diagnosis is made between the age of two and five, but transcriptomes from pre-symptomatic DMD patients reveal typical dystrophic abnormalities [<xref rid="B1-cancers-15-01378" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. In fact, studies of human fetuses [<xref rid="B2-cancers-15-01378" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="B3-cancers-15-01378" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="B4-cancers-15-01378" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] and in various animal models [<xref rid="B5-cancers-15-01378" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="B6-cancers-15-01378" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="B7-cancers-15-01378" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] revealed that the pathology starts during prenatal development and continues into adulthood. The first DMD defects are detectable in developing cells even before their differentiation into muscle [<xref rid="B8-cancers-15-01378" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Given that muscle regeneration replicates processes occurring in muscle development, and that some developmental mechanisms are reactivated in tumors, it is intriguing that changes in <italic toggle="yes">DMD</italic> gene expression are increasingly being described in various malignancies [<xref rid="B9-cancers-15-01378" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Moreover, <italic toggle="yes">DMD</italic> downregulation affects cell proliferation [<xref rid="B10-cancers-15-01378" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="B11-cancers-15-01378" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="B12-cancers-15-01378" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], adhesion, migration, and invasion [<xref rid="B12-cancers-15-01378" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]&#x02014;traits that are commonly associated with tumor development. Gaining some understanding of whether these alterations, in a range of diverse cells, have a common origin and lead to a related outcome would expand our knowledge of the role of the <italic toggle="yes">DMD</italic> gene and potentially open up new treatment avenues.</p><p>Such analysis must take into consideration the complexity of DMD, the largest human gene known, with 79 exons and eight independent tissue-specific promoters driving the expression of distinct dystrophin isoforms. Three promoters control the expression of 14-kb full-length transcripts encoding 427 kDa isoforms (Dp427). The Dp427m is expressed in myofibers and muscle stem (satellite) cells. In myofibers, it interacts with the dystrophin-associated protein complex (DAPC) [<xref rid="B13-cancers-15-01378" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] with structural and scaffolding roles and an involvement in the regulation of various signaling pathways [<xref rid="B14-cancers-15-01378" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Yet, in satellite cells, Dp427m has a different interactome and it is essential for asymmetric cell divisions [<xref rid="B11-cancers-15-01378" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="B15-cancers-15-01378" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]; in myoblasts the loss of its expression results in abnormalities of cell proliferation and migration [<xref rid="B10-cancers-15-01378" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="B16-cancers-15-01378" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="B17-cancers-15-01378" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Dp427c and Dp427p full-length dystrophins are expressed in various neurons [<xref rid="B18-cancers-15-01378" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="B19-cancers-15-01378" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], where their loss during development has been linked to the neuropsychological impairment in DMD.</p><p>Moreover, intragenic promoters give rise to transcripts encoding truncated isoforms: Dp260 in the retina, Dp140 in the CNS, Dp116 in Schwann glia [<xref rid="B20-cancers-15-01378" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], and Dp71, which is the most ubiquitous <italic toggle="yes">DMD</italic> product. Alternative splicing adds further structural and functional diversity [<xref rid="B21-cancers-15-01378" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="B22-cancers-15-01378" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. <italic toggle="yes">DMD</italic> transcripts are summarized in <xref rid="app1-cancers-15-01378" ref-type="app">Figure S1 of Supplementary File S1</xref>.</p><p>Importantly, loss of Dp427 expression, which is both necessary and sufficient for the occurrence of Duchenne MD, was also associated with increased metastasis of tumors with myogenic programs [<xref rid="B17-cancers-15-01378" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] and soft tissue sarcomas [<xref rid="B23-cancers-15-01378" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. In contrast to this potential tumor suppressor role of the full-length dystrophin, Dp71 expression was essential for myogenic tumor cell growth [<xref rid="B17-cancers-15-01378" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="B23-cancers-15-01378" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Interestingly, a putative role for the <italic toggle="yes">DMD</italic> gene was also suggested in various non-myogenic cancers, including carcinomas [<xref rid="B24-cancers-15-01378" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="B25-cancers-15-01378" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="B26-cancers-15-01378" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], melanoma [<xref rid="B27-cancers-15-01378" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], leukemia [<xref rid="B28-cancers-15-01378" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>], lymphoma [<xref rid="B24-cancers-15-01378" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], and CNS tumors [<xref rid="B29-cancers-15-01378" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="B30-cancers-15-01378" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="B31-cancers-15-01378" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>].</p><p>Yet, many of the tumors showing phenotypic changes associated with decreased <italic toggle="yes">DMD</italic> gene expression originate from healthy tissues that are not generally believed to express the full-length dystrophin protein. Seemingly paradoxical, this observation is not limited to tumors: myoblasts, lymphocytes, and endotheliocytes express 14-kb dystrophin transcripts but are not known to synthesize detectable levels of dystrophin protein. Nevertheless, <italic toggle="yes">DMD</italic> downregulation leads to significant functional abnormalities in these cells [<xref rid="B16-cancers-15-01378" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="B32-cancers-15-01378" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="B33-cancers-15-01378" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>].</p><p>We hypothesized that malignancy can be used as a model to investigate changes in <italic toggle="yes">DMD</italic> gene expression across normal tissues and corresponding tumors, and aid our understanding of the overall role of this gene, which clearly extends beyond Duchenne MD. Therefore, we studied <italic toggle="yes">DMD</italic> mRNA and protein expression across various normal tissues and matching tumors, and explored transcriptomic alterations in primary tumors and corresponding tumor cell lines with altered <italic toggle="yes">DMD</italic> expression to identify putative downstream molecular pathways that could be associated with <italic toggle="yes">DMD</italic> dysregulation across human tissues.

Thus, these pathways and processes were identical with those found in comparisons with low vs. high expression of Dp427m in completely unrelated malignancies. A comparison between random groups of samples from these hematological tumors did not reveal any statistically significant changes in gene expression.</p></sec><sec id="sec3dot12-cancers-15-01378"><title>3.12.

Discussion</title><p>We found a significant downregulation of <italic toggle="yes">DMD</italic> gene expression across diverse primary tumors. Both full-length and truncated dystrophin variants were differentially expressed, and hierarchical clustering of the top highly expressed transcripts distinguished tumors from corresponding control tissue samples. A similar trend for <italic toggle="yes">DMD</italic> downregulation across carcinomas has been described previously [<xref rid="B24-cancers-15-01378" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], and our analysis discriminating specific <italic toggle="yes">DMD</italic> transcripts showed that levels of Dp427m mRNA were statistically significantly decreased in the clusters composed mainly of tumor tissues (<xref rid="app1-cancers-15-01378" ref-type="app">Supplementary Figure S4</xref>), suggesting a specific impact of the loss of the full-length transcript. Indeed, pancreatic adenocarcinoma was the only primary tumor with higher levels of Dp427m transcripts compared to healthy pancreas tissue. In contrast, the relative expression of Dp71 splice variants was increased in tumor clusters.</p><p>In contrast to the majority of primary tumor samples, in hematological malignancies, total <italic toggle="yes">DMD</italic> expression and the expression of the full-length and Dp71 transcripts was higher or unchanged when compared to normal blood, which also showed the lowest <italic toggle="yes">DMD</italic> expression relative to housekeeping genes of all the healthy tissues analyzed (<xref rid="app1-cancers-15-01378" ref-type="app">Supplementary Table S3</xref>). However, human and mouse hematopoietic stem cells were found to express Dp71, and its expression was decreasing with cell differentiation (manuscript submitted), which agrees with whole blood showing the lowest <italic toggle="yes">DMD</italic> expression. Interestingly, while Dp71 expression is found upregulated in hematological malignancies, its low levels were found to be associated with the very same dystrophic molecular alterations in cancer cells.</p><p>Despite the advantage that using NATs as control samples in cancer studies reduces individual and anatomical site-specific confounding factors and eliminates technical interlaboratory differences, it was found that these tissues are distinct from healthy and tumor tissues and represent a unique intermediate state between them [<xref rid="B48-cancers-15-01378" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. Although we showed that the results of comparing <italic toggle="yes">DMD</italic> expression between TCGA tumors and their corresponding NATs were consistent with those of comparing <italic toggle="yes">DMD</italic> expression between TCGA tumors and healthy GTEx tissues in 11 out of 13 comparisons, the unique transcriptomic profile of NATs might explain why thyroid NATs and kidney NATs from three different kidney TCGA tumors clustered with tumor tissues in the third cluster. The opposite was observed in the second cluster, where PRAD and SKCM samples clustered with control tissues. This might be the result of a high proportion of non-tumor cells in these tumor samples.</p><p>Given some evidence of a causative link between <italic toggle="yes">DMD</italic> downregulation and phenotypic changes in tumor cells [<xref rid="B17-cancers-15-01378" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="B23-cancers-15-01378" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] and that alterations in Duchenne, such as increased cell proliferation, abnormalities in adhesion, migration, and invasion [<xref rid="B11-cancers-15-01378" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="B12-cancers-15-01378" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] are commonly associated with malignancy, transcriptomes of primary tumor samples as well as tumor cell lines with low vs. high levels of <italic toggle="yes">DMD</italic> gene expression were compared.</p><p>While no causation can be confirmed at this stage, it is important to note that <italic toggle="yes">DMD</italic> dysregulation was associated with specific transcriptomic changes across 15 primary tumors and 140 various tumor cell lines (summarized in <xref rid="cancers-15-01378-f009" ref-type="fig">Figure 9</xref>). </p><p>Functional enrichment analysis showed that the pathways and GO Biological Process terms significantly enriched in DEGs in primary tumors and cell lines with low vs. high <italic toggle="yes">DMD</italic> expression were consistent with the pathways and GO terms enriched in DEGs in DMD skeletal muscle as well as the functional dystrophin PPI network (<xref rid="app1-cancers-15-01378" ref-type="app">Supplementary Figure S6</xref>). Key pathways altered, including cell adhesion, ECM interactions, and PI3K-Akt signaling, correspond to alterations found in Duchenne patients&#x02019; cells [<xref rid="B49-cancers-15-01378" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>,<xref rid="B50-cancers-15-01378" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. The calcium signaling pathway enriched in DEGs in tumors samples with low <italic toggle="yes">DMD</italic> expression from 13 out of the 15 analyzed primary tumors, and well as in sarcoma cell lines with low <italic toggle="yes">DMD</italic> expression, agrees with the dysregulation of calcium signaling across a whole spectrum of dystrophic cells (reviewed in [<xref rid="B51-cancers-15-01378" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]), as do GO terms related to the regulation of the developmental mechanisms [<xref rid="B8-cancers-15-01378" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Thus, the <italic toggle="yes">DMD</italic> gene may play similar roles in cancer and development, two processes showing biological and molecular similarities [<xref rid="B52-cancers-15-01378" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>].</p><p>The protein digestion and absorption amongst the top pathways identified is somewhat surprising, but it is also present in DMD muscles and must reflect the overlap between DEGs. For example, 17 genes in this pathway are shared with the ECM receptor interaction, focal adhesion, and PI3K-Akt, and six genes are shared with the cAMP and cGMP-PKG signaling pathways.</p><p>Dystrophin in tumor cell lines did not correlate strongly with the presence of its established DAPC partners, suggesting that it may have a different role(s) than those in muscle cells (<xref rid="app1-cancers-15-01378" ref-type="app">Supplementary Table S8</xref>). This is unsurprising, given that DAPs are known to differ in different tissues, with muscle and brain being the most notable examples. But even within muscle, the dystrophin interactome changes with differentiation, and functionally distinct DAPs exist in satellite cells and myofibers.</p><p>The importance of the <italic toggle="yes">DMD</italic> gene in tumorigenesis is supported by the finding that low <italic toggle="yes">DMD</italic> expression was associated with poor survival outcomes in patients with 15 different types of tumors (14 carcinomas and sarcoma). The overall survival of cancer patients with decreased <italic toggle="yes">DMD</italic> expression in tumors was 27 months lower than that of patients with high <italic toggle="yes">DMD</italic> expression. However, since the low and high <italic toggle="yes">DMD</italic> groups used in this analysis were composed of 15 tumor types, the number of samples for each of those types is highly variable between the two groups, and this could possibly be a confounding factor when interpreting the results. In other studies, mutations in the <italic toggle="yes">DMD</italic> gene were associated with poor overall survival of patients of two out of 11 analyzed tumors, namely uterine corpus endometrioid carcinoma and breast invasive carcinoma [<xref rid="B24-cancers-15-01378" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Dystrophin protein was also identified as a survival biomarker in upper gastrointestinal cancer patients, as poorer survival was observed in patients with low compared to high levels of dystrophin protein [<xref rid="B53-cancers-15-01378" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>].</p><p>In our analyses, the overall survival of patients suffering from hematological malignancies with decreased Dp71 expression was about 39 months lower than that of patients with high Dp71 expression. However, in low-grade glioma [<xref rid="B54-cancers-15-01378" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>] and B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia [<xref rid="B28-cancers-15-01378" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>], high Dp71 expression was previously associated with poor patient survival.</p><p>We found <italic toggle="yes">DMD</italic> expression to be associated with the tumor stage. Samples from patients with stage I had significantly higher levels of <italic toggle="yes">DMD</italic> expression compared to higher stages after controlling for age and gender differences.</p><p><italic toggle="yes">DMD</italic> expression was also found to decrease with the age of onset, as samples from younger patients had higher <italic toggle="yes">DMD</italic> expression compared to samples from older patients. This association between <italic toggle="yes">DMD</italic> expression and age was unique to tumor tissues, as no such association was found by us in the corresponding healthy tissues from the GTEx database, and also in a meta-analysis that identified genes with age-associated expression in human peripheral blood samples [<xref rid="B55-cancers-15-01378" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>].</p><p>It is worth noting that recent studies identified increased frequency of rhabdomyosarcomas in DMD patients [<xref rid="B56-cancers-15-01378" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>,<xref rid="B57-cancers-15-01378" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>] which agrees with previous data on spontaneous rhabdomyosarcomas in dystrophic mice [<xref rid="B58-cancers-15-01378" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>].</p><p>Crucially, we demonstrated downregulation of <italic toggle="yes">DMD</italic> expression in tumors with incidence increasing with age. Therefore, with improved therapies, the risk of malignancy in DMD should be considered. As for hematological malignancies, which frequently affect children, poor survival was associated with Dp71 downregulation. Expression of this dystrophin is not affected in the vast majority of DMD patients.</p><p>A further indication of the functional significance of the <italic toggle="yes">DMD</italic> gene in tumors is that <italic toggle="yes">DMD</italic> downregulation across various malignancies involves regulatory changes, not just results from somatic gene mutations. Although, as expected, the presence of some types of somatic mutations and SCNAs was associated with lower levels of <italic toggle="yes">DMD</italic> expression, in about 88% of tumor samples and 77% of cell lines, <italic toggle="yes">DMD</italic> downregulation could not be linked to mutations in the coding regions of the <italic toggle="yes">DMD</italic> gene. Moreover, <italic toggle="yes">DMD</italic> downregulation was not a result of SCNAs in about 61% of samples from female patients and about 56% of samples from male patients. While deletions were described as a causative factor for the downregulation of <italic toggle="yes">DMD</italic> gene expression in some tumors [<xref rid="B17-cancers-15-01378" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="B23-cancers-15-01378" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="B30-cancers-15-01378" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>], significantly reduced expression was also found in the absence of deletions or nonsense mutations [<xref rid="B27-cancers-15-01378" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], in agreement with our comprehensive analysis across different malignancies. Moreover, in primary pancreatic adenocarcinoma, Dp427m transcript was increased while Dp71 expression was reduced (<xref rid="app1-cancers-15-01378" ref-type="app">Supplementary Figure S5B</xref>). Given the <italic toggle="yes">DMD</italic> gene structure, such an expression pattern can only be explained by differential regulation. Targeted degradation of dystrophin transcripts was suggested before [<xref rid="B59-cancers-15-01378" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>], and recently, an epigenetic mechanism responsible for reduced <italic toggle="yes">DMD</italic> transcript levels has been described [<xref rid="B60-cancers-15-01378" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. These data indicate that, rather than simply being an effect of random mutations, quite likely to occur in this large gene, <italic toggle="yes">DMD</italic> alterations in tumor cells may have a complex regulatory nature involving mechanisms such as transcriptional regulation, chromatin remodeling, or transcript degradation. Given that miRNAs might be responsible for the differential regulation of <italic toggle="yes">DMD</italic> expression in tumor samples, we investigated but did not find any differentially expressed miRNAs in tumor samples with low vs. high <italic toggle="yes">DMD</italic> expression that were common to all of the 15 primary tumor types analyzed (<xref rid="app1-cancers-15-01378" ref-type="app">Supplementary Table S9</xref>).</p><p>Thus, specific alterations in <italic toggle="yes">DMD</italic> gene expression are a common feature across a spectrum of malignancies, including those originating from tissues previously not associated with the expression of the full-length dystrophin. Yet, we found <italic toggle="yes">DMD</italic> transcript levels in these tissues to be comparable to the levels of housekeeping genes. Moreover, interrogation of proteomics datasets demonstrated a much wider distribution profile for the full-length dystrophin protein (<xref rid="app1-cancers-15-01378" ref-type="app">Supplementary Figure S2</xref>). Interestingly, according to the Human Protein Atlas [<xref rid="B38-cancers-15-01378" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>], the antibody HPA002725, directed against amino acids 186&#x02013;333 of the full-length dystrophin, detected moderate cytoplasmic and/or membrane staining in a range of normal tissues in addition to the expected staining in skeletal and cardiac muscle and the CNS. However, the antibody HPA023885, raised against amino acids 2843&#x02013;2992 and therefore supposed to detect all dystrophin isoforms upstream of Dp71, showed staining in skeletal and cardiac muscle, while other tissues were negative. This staining pattern disagrees with the established expression of Dp260, Dp140, and Dp116, which is broader than that of Dp427 isoforms, and so it could not be accurate. Given the high sensitivity and specificity of the mass-spec [<xref rid="B61-cancers-15-01378" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>,<xref rid="B62-cancers-15-01378" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>], identification of the full-length dystrophin in a wide spectrum of normal tissues using this latter method is likely to represent the true expression status. Thus, dystrophin may be present in many tissues at low levels and/or in a tightly controlled spatiotemporal manner, which might be missed using standard detection methods.</p><p>The molecular signature associated with decreased <italic toggle="yes">DMD</italic> expression in tumors and corresponding tumor cell lines is concordant with that found in Duchenne muscular dystrophy. The <italic toggle="yes">DMD</italic> gene encodes a spectrum of dystrophin isoforms, but significant expression of the majority of these appeared to be restricted to specific tissues. While loss of the full-length dystrophin results in Duchenne muscular dystrophy, mutations additionally disrupting other isoforms result in exacerbated phenotypes [<xref rid="B36-cancers-15-01378" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>,<xref rid="B63-cancers-15-01378" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>]. In skeletal myofibers, cardiomyocytes, and neurons, which express the highest levels of the full-length dystrophin, this protein has been described to serve as a structural scaffold for proteins engaged in ECM and cell-cell interactions, and in intracellular signaling. However, more recent data demonstrate that the loss of <italic toggle="yes">DMD</italic> expression impacts a broader spectrum of cells than those affected in DMD. In myoblasts [<xref rid="B10-cancers-15-01378" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="B16-cancers-15-01378" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="B64-cancers-15-01378" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>,<xref rid="B65-cancers-15-01378" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>], lymphocytes [<xref rid="B33-cancers-15-01378" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>], endotheliocytes [<xref rid="B32-cancers-15-01378" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="B66-cancers-15-01378" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>,<xref rid="B67-cancers-15-01378" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>], mesodermal [<xref rid="B8-cancers-15-01378" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], and myogenic cells [<xref rid="B11-cancers-15-01378" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="B15-cancers-15-01378" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], loss of <italic toggle="yes">DMD</italic> expression leads to significant abnormalities. Moreover, the same abnormalities can occur in very distinct cells, e.g., calcium dys-homeostasis was found across multiple cells [<xref rid="B51-cancers-15-01378" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>], and the damaging purinergic phenotype affects myoblasts and lymphocytes [<xref rid="B33-cancers-15-01378" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,<xref rid="B65-cancers-15-01378" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>]. Some old findings, such as platelet abnormalities [<xref rid="B68-cancers-15-01378" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>], have recently been vindicated [<xref rid="B69-cancers-15-01378" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>]. Yet, these defects cannot be clearly attributed to the loss of interaction between dystrophin and the known dystrophin-associated proteins. Indeed, these cell-autonomous defects appear to affect dystrophic cells, which, when healthy, express the 14-kb <italic toggle="yes">DMD</italic> transcript, but were not shown to produce detectable levels of full-length dystrophins. This phenomenon, where expression of the 14-kb <italic toggle="yes">DMD</italic> transcript in cells such as myoblasts and lymphocytes does not correlate with detectable dystrophin protein, was known for decades but just disregarded as an &#x0201c;illegitimate transcription&#x0201d; [<xref rid="B70-cancers-15-01378" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>].</p><p>Our data suggest that more attention should be given to the subtler <italic toggle="yes">DMD</italic> gene functions, beyond those causing the main symptoms of DMD. Such studies have a potential to identify new therapeutic targets for the treatment of this debilitating and still incurable disease. Moreover, given the poor survival rate of patients with tumors downregulating dystrophin, the <italic toggle="yes">DMD</italic> gene may be important in oncology.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec5-cancers-15-01378"><title>5.
