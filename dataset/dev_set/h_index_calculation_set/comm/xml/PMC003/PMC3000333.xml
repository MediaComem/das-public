Although it has multiple roles in plants, it is unclear how its accumulation is controlled at the expression level, especially in sink tissues. Kiwifruit (<italic>Actinidia</italic>) is well-known for its high ascorbate content. Our objective was to determine whether AsA accumulates in the fruits primarily through biosynthesis or because it is imported from the foliage.</p></sec><sec><title>Methodology/Principal Findings</title><p>We systematically investigated AsA levels, biosynthetic capacity, and mRNA expression of genes involved in AsA biosynthesis in kiwi (<italic>A</italic>. <italic>deliciosa</italic> cv. Qinmei). Recycling and AsA localization were also monitored during fruit development and among different tissue types. Over time, the amount of AsA, with its capacity for higher biosynthesis and lower recycling, peaked at 30 days after anthesis (DAA), and then decreased markedly up to 60 DAA before declining more slowly. Expression of key genes showed similar patterns of change, except for L-galactono-1,4-lactone dehydrogenase and L-galactose-1-phosphate phosphatase (GPP). However, GPP had good correlation with the rate of AsA accumulation. The expression of these genes could be detected in phloem of stem as well as petiole of leaf and fruit. Additionally, fruit petioles had greater ascorbate amounts, although that was the site of lowest expression by most genes. Fruit microtubule tissues also had higher AsA. However, exogenous applications of AsA to those petioles did not lead to its transport into fruits, and distribution of ascorbate was cell-specific in the fruits, with more accumulation occurring in larger cells.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>These results suggest that AsA biosynthesis in kiwi during early fruit development is the main reason for its accumulation in the fruits. We also postulate here that GPP is a good candidate for regulating AsA biosynthesis whereas GDP-L-galactose-1-phosphate phosphorylase is not.</p></sec></abstract><counts><page-count count="14"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>L-Ascorbic acid (AsA), also called Vitamin C or ascorbate, is one of the most abundant antioxidants, and is a cofactor for many dioxygenases in plants. Because of these unique functions as well as its benefits to human health, increasing attention has been paid to AsA synthesis and regulation in plant tissues <xref rid="pone.0014281-Linster1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0014281-Ioannidi1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. <italic>De novo</italic> biosynthesis is believed to be a main reason for its accumulation in plant cells. A pathway for AsA formation has also been completely characterized in animal systems <xref rid="pone.0014281-Chatterjee1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. This pathway involves D-glucose as the initial precursor, with the last step being catalysis by L-gulono-1, 4-lactone oxidase, which oxidizes L-gulono-1, 4-lactone (L-GulL) to produce AsA. Only recently has strong evidence been reported for a novel pathway in plants that differs from that in animals <xref rid="pone.0014281-Wheeler1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. Phenotypic analysis of mutant or transgenic plants has demonstrated the operation of the L-galactose or Smirnoff&#x02013;Wheeler pathway as a main AsA biosynthetic route <xref rid="pone.0014281-Wheeler1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0014281-Linster2" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. There, ascorbate can be synthesized from D-mannose-1-phosphate via GDP-mannose and GDP-L-galactose (GDP-L-Gal). Free L-galactose (L-Gal) is released from GDP-L-Gal through the action of GDP-L-Gal phosphorylase (GGP) <xref rid="pone.0014281-Dowdle1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref> and L-galactose -1-phosphate phosphatase (GPP) <xref rid="pone.0014281-Conklin1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. It is then oxidized by L-Gal dehydrogenase (GalDH) to form L-galactono-1,4-lactone (L-GL) <xref rid="pone.0014281-Wheeler1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. L-GL is oxidized to AsA by L-galactono-1, 4-lactone dehydrogenase (GalLDH) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0014281-g001">Figure 1A, C</xref>).</p><fig id="pone-0014281-g001" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0014281.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Possible schemes for ascorbate accumulation in fruits <xref rid="pone.0014281-Conklin2" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0014281-Hancock2" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>.</title><p>(A) suggested pathways of AsA biosynthesis.

These include the D-galacturonic acid pathway, which utilizes D-galacturonic acid for the synthesis of L-galacturonic acid derivatives via D-galacturonate reductase (GalUR). This also requires GalLDH to produce AsA in the last step <xref rid="pone.0014281-Agius1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. Second, the L-gulose pathway utilizes L-gulonic derivatives and is a branch of the L-galactose pathway <xref rid="pone.0014281-Wolucka1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. Finally, the myo-inositol pathway synthesizes L-gulonic derivatives from myo-inositol (MI) <xref rid="pone.0014281-Lorence1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0014281-Zhang1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. All of these pathways possibly cooperate with the L-galactose pathway or else work in different tissues or under various physiological conditions <xref rid="pone.0014281-Ishikawa1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. AsA translocation from source to sink tissues has been demonstrated in a range of plants, including <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>, <italic>Medicago sativa</italic>
<xref rid="pone.0014281-Franceschi1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, and <italic>Solanum tuberosum</italic>
<xref rid="pone.0014281-Tedone1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. Its biosynthesis also has been reported to occur within phloem strands <xref rid="pone.0014281-Hancock1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>.</p><p>When formed, AsA is not a stable metabolic product but can be oxidized to monodehydroascorbate radicals (MDHA) and dehydroascorbate (DHA), functioning as a major antioxidant to scavenge reactive oxygen species or as an enzymatic cofactor <xref rid="pone.0014281-Noctor1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. The resulting MDHA and DHA can be enzymatically reduced to AsA by NADPH- or NADH-dependent monodehydroascorbate reductase (MDHAR; EC 1.6.5.4) and dehydroascorbate reductase (DHAR; EC 1.8.5.1) respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0014281-g001">Figure 1C</xref>) <xref rid="pone.0014281-Noctor1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. The importance of MDHAR and DHAR in regulating AsA levels has been shown in transgenic plants by expressing enzymes involved in the recycling of oxidized AsA, including DHAR <xref rid="pone.0014281-Chen1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref> and MDHAR <xref rid="pone.0014281-Eltayeb1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>.</p><p>Fruits and vegetables are the major sources of AsA for the human system, which is unable to synthesize it but must secure it through dietary uptake <xref rid="pone.0014281-Li1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. Consequently, researchers need an improved understanding of how ascorbate levels are controlled in fruits. Although the genetics and biochemistry of AsA biosynthesis and information about its physiological roles have been reported for photosynthetic tissues <xref rid="pone.0014281-Ishikawa1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0014281-Hancock2" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>, few studies have focused on the mechanism for its molecular regulation and accumulation in sink tissues (e.g., tubers and fruits).</p><p>Kiwifruit (<italic>Actinidia</italic>), one of the most popular fruits, is highly regarded for its high AsA content. Ascorbate synthesis is known to occur within the fruits themselves <xref rid="pone.0014281-Bulley1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, such as acerola <xref rid="pone.0014281-Badejo1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>, blackcurrant <xref rid="pone.0014281-Hancock3" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>, and apple <xref rid="pone.0014281-Li2" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. However, AsA biosynthesis has not been characterized in kiwi fruit. Although its translocation has been demonstrated from source to sink tissues <xref rid="pone.0014281-Franceschi1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0014281-Tedone1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, researchers have not previously determined whether AsA accumulation in the fruits results mainly from synthesis <italic>in situ</italic> or via import from the foliage. Bulley <italic>et al.</italic>
<xref rid="pone.0014281-Bulley1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref> have suggested that the transcript level of <italic>GGP</italic> in various genotypes of kiwi is a major control point because its expression is correlated with AsA content during fruit development. Furthermore, overexpression of that gene leads to an increased AsA supply in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> plants. However, GGP transcripts are not correlated with AsA content and accumulation rate whereas those of GPP are strongly correlated in tomato fruits <xref rid="pone.0014281-Ioannidi1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref> and apple leaves <xref rid="pone.0014281-Li3" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. Therefore, the relationship between GGP or GPP to AsA in kiwi fruits requires further analysis.</p><p>To gain new insights into the regulatory mechanisms for AsA accumulation in the fruits of kiwi, we performed a systematic investigation of AsA levels, mRNA expression of genes involved in its biosynthesis, and the activities of enzymes and recycling processes over time and among different tissues (especially conducting tissues). We also examined the relationship between ascorbate in fruit petioles and flesh and its distribution in the fruits. Our objectives were to 1) obtain information useful to breeding programs that focus on improving AsA contents in fruits, and 2) elucidate the mechanisms that regulate AsA accumulations in the cells of sink organs.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Plant materials</title><p>Six-year-old vines of kiwi (<italic>Actinidia deliciosa</italic> cv. Qinmei) were trained as a trellis system and grown at a 2&#x000d7;3 m spacing in an experimental orchard at the Horticultural Experimental Station of Northwest A &#x00026; F University, Yangling, China (34&#x000b0;20&#x02032;N, 108&#x000b0;24&#x02032;E). Fruits were harvested at 15-d intervals following anthesis (&#x000b1;3 d; DAA, days after anthesis), between 4 and 5 PM. The day on which the petals had just dropped off was designated as 0 DAA. Mature leaves also were collected at each time point. Fruits were directly sampled through their transverse centers, using a cork borer (0.5-cm diam.). They were immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at &#x02212;80&#x000b0;C. At each collection time point, four replications were made, with each comprising six fruits from the same vine.</p><p>To evaluate the relationship between AsA levels and expression of related genes in conducting tissues within the same tree at 40 DAA, we obtained mature leaves, young leaves (leaf area &#x0200a;=&#x0200a;1.0 to 1.5 cm<sup>2</sup>), petioles from leaves and fruits, and phloem from branch samples (four replications). All were immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at &#x02212;80&#x000b0;C.</p><p>To determine whether AsA contents are correlated between fruit petioles and flesh, we performed two independent experiments. First, fruits with their petioles were harvested at about 28 DAA and 140 DAA, and placed on ice. In the lab, the petiole nodes were cut under water, then inserted into a 10 mM AsA solution and cultured for 24 h in a pre-humidified atmosphere at 20&#x000b0;C. Samples of flesh and core were also measured for AsA levels in this manner while control samples were cultured only in water. The second experiment, done with <italic>in vivo</italic> tissues, entailed lightly scratching the surface of the fruit petioles with a hacksaw blade at about 15 DAA and 130 DAA. The petioles were immediately washed with water, then wrapped with cotton cord. Afterward, 5 mM AsA, DHA, or L-GL (each dissolved in 20 mM MES buffer, pH 6.0) was applied to the cord before covering the tissue with film to preserve freshness. At 3-d intervals, 5 mM AsA, DHA, or L-GL was again added; fruits and petioles were harvested after 15 d of this treatment. As our control, 20 mM MES buffer (pH 6.0) was applied alone.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Assays for AsA</title><p>Samples of fruit (2 g each) or leaves (0.5 g) were homogenized in 8 mL of ice-cold 6&#x00025; (v/v) HClO<sub>4</sub> and centrifuged at 12,000 <italic>g</italic> for 20 min at 2&#x000b0;C. Hepes buffer (0.1 M; pH 7.0) was added to the extracts at a 1&#x02236;5 ratio (buffer:extract, v:v); K<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub> (5 M) was then added in until the pH reached 5.6. Extracts were centrifuged again at 12,000 <italic>g</italic> for 2 min to allow the removal of precipitated K<sub>2</sub>ClO<sub>4</sub>, and the supernatants were used to assay total ascorbate (AsA &#x0002b; DHA, T-AsA), AsA and DHA as described by Ma and Cheng <xref rid="pone.0014281-Ma1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>. That assay is based on the oxidation of AsA by ascorbate oxidase in an acidic solution. AsA was calculated as the difference in absorption at 265 nm before and after the addition of ascorbate oxidase. Its concentration was quantified by comparing the difference in absorption relative to a standard curve.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>AsA biosynthesis tested by feeding with candidate precursors</title><p>Fruits were sampled at 30, 75, and 125 DAA by removing fresh tissues with a cork borer (1-cm diam.) and cutting them into 0.3-cm-thick discs.

<xref rid="pone.0014281-Bulley1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref> have reported that AsA contents in kiwifruit are highly regulated by developmental processes. Our results showed that ovaries after anthesis had less ascorbate and were more oxidized. This AsA pool increased over time, peaking at 30 DAA, and then decreased to Day 60 before remaining largely unchanged toward maturation. This suggests that, while &#x02018;Qinmei&#x02019; fruits were developing in the first 30 d, the rate of AsA formation (based on fresh weight) exceeded the rate of oxidation loss (DHA degradation). However, as those fruits began to ripen, oxidation loss exceeded ascorbate production. This pattern is similar to that for <italic>Actinidia chinensis</italic> MP097 and MP212 <xref rid="pone.0014281-Bulley1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. Higher AsA contents also have been reported in the young fruits of acerola <xref rid="pone.0014281-Badejo1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref> and peach <xref rid="pone.0014281-Imai1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>. By comparison, such levels tend to increase over time in the fruits of tomato <xref rid="pone.0014281-Ioannidi1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. Therefore, regulation of AsA during developmental processes differs among species. Here, ascorbate steadily accumulated up to Day 45, and then remained fairly constant as the fruit matured. This has also been observed in the fruits of blackcurrant <xref rid="pone.0014281-Hancock3" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>, where biosynthetic capacity is greater in the earlier stages.</p><p>When fruit discs representing different developmental stages were incubated with non-labeled putative substrates to synthesize ascorbate, D-Glc, L-Gal, and L-GL clearly enhanced AsA levels in 30-DAA discs, a response that has also been reported with pea seedlings <xref rid="pone.0014281-Pallanca1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>. This demonstrated that kiwi fruits are capable of AsA biosynthesis via the L-galactose pathway, and that the capacity to produce AsA is greater at Day 30 than at Day 75 or later, which is in agreement with patterns of AsA accumulation. L-GulL and D-GalUA also stimulated AsA levels in 30-DAA discs, indicating that young fruits utilize uronic acid (derivatives) for ascorbate synthesis <xref rid="pone.0014281-Li2" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0014281-Pallanca1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>. Although the enzyme that catalyzes L-GulL to AsA has not yet been identified in plant cells, Leferink <italic>et al.</italic>
<xref rid="pone.0014281-Leferink1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref> have reported that recombinant GalLDH of <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> is not strictly specific to L-GL but can also oxidize L-GulL to AsA at significant rates. Therefore, future research should characterize kiwifruit GalLDH protein and assess its capacity for catalysis to L-GulL, based on our finding that AsA levels were less affected by feeding with L-GulL than with L-GL. Although the <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> genome contains several genes homologous to rat L-gulono-1,4-lactone oxidase (e.g., AT2G4676, AT5G11540), we found no apparent change in AsA content for T-DNA insertional mutations of AT2G4676 (our unpublished data).</p><p>Ascorbate is translocated from source to sink tissues in <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>, <italic>Medicago sativa</italic>

<xref rid="pone.0014281-Tedone1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. Here, the petioles from 40-DAA fruits had much more AsA than did the leaf petioles or phloem. However, except for <italic>GalUR3</italic>, those fruit petioles showed the lowest expression for genes encoding AsA-biosynthesis enzymes. The level of expression was in proportion to the amount of ascorbate that accumulated in each tissue type. Abundant AsA was measured in phloem exudates collected from the petioles of source leaves and 30-DAA fruits. It was also found in microtubule cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0014281-g009">Figure 9</xref>), after being located via the acidic-alcoholic AgNO3 method, which is specific to AsA at 4&#x000b0;C <xref rid="pone.0014281-Chinoy1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>. Therefore, our current results might lead us to conclude that long-distance transport of AsA occurs in <italic>Actinidia</italic>, and that its presence in the fruit could partly depend upon its movement from the leaves. However, both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>, exogenous applications of AsA, DHA, or L-GL to the fruit petioles at young and mature stages did not enhance ascorbate in those fruits even though those contents were dramatically increased in the petioles. Because AsA deposits were not found in the cells surrounding the microtubules, it is possible that this region has an important role in unloading compounds from the microtubule tissues into the fruit flesh. These results suggest that AsA is not readily transported into the flesh and must, instead, be synthesized within that tissue, a process that has also been proposed with blackcurrant <xref rid="pone.0014281-Hancock3" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. Differences in AsA distribution between large and small cells of the flesh also indicated that transport does not occur between the two types, and that the capacity for AsA biosynthesis is cell-specific in kiwifruit, despite the existence of 12 putative nucleobase-ascorbate transporters <xref rid="pone.0014281-Maurino1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>.</p><p>AsA localization to the vascular tissue has been observed histochemically in sections from potato stems and tubers <xref rid="pone.0014281-Tedone1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref> and apple fruits <xref rid="pone.0014281-Li2" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref> that have been incubated with ethanolic AgNO<sub>3</sub> under low temperature; those earlier results confirm the long-distance transport of AsA.

Based on all of these results, therefore, we conclude that the main role for AsA conjugates with glycosides in the phloem is the transport of those glycosides rather than of AsA. This conjugation with AsA (which has strong redox properties) increases glycoside stability. When carried into fruit, the conjugates are decomposed into glycoside and AsA before the former are unloaded into the flesh cells, so that AsA remains in the vascular tissue and fruit petioles as an antioxidant. This might explain why ascorbate is so abundant in kiwi fruit petioles and microtubule cells. In addition, AsA that has been localized with ethanolic AgNO<sub>3</sub> in the vascular tissue might be partial AsA conjugates and not just AsA because those conjugates have redox properties similar to AsA <xref rid="pone.0014281-Hancock4" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>.

<xref rid="pone.0014281-RokniZadeh1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>.

Therefore, these results suggest that expression of post-transcriptionally regulated <italic>GalLDH</italic> is not a main controlling factor of AsA levels, as has also been previously proposed by Linster and Clarke <xref rid="pone.0014281-Linster1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>.</p><p>GalDH is a key enzyme that determines whether a plant can synthesize AsA via the L-galactose pathway <xref rid="pone.0014281-Wheeler1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>.

<xref rid="pone.0014281-Bulley1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. In 30-DAA fruits, GalDH expression was similar to that in mature leaves, perhaps because AsA was accumulating at that time.

However, Torabinejad <italic>et</italic> al. <xref rid="pone.0014281-Torabinejad1" ref-type="bibr">[46]</xref> reported that its protein of Arabidopsis was a bifunctional enzyme and can hydrolyze by L-gal-1-P and myo-inositol-1-phosphate. GPP has some homology with myo-inositol-1-phosphate phosphatase (MIPP), which catalyzes myo-inositol-1-phosphate to myo-inositol. Although IMPL-2, involved in histidine synthesis, is unable to catalyze L-Gal-1-P to L-Gal <xref rid="pone.0014281-Petersen1" ref-type="bibr">[47]</xref>, IMPL-1 of <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> can hydrolyze by L-Gal-1-P to L-Gal, and can restore AsA biosynthesis when <italic>GPP</italic> is inhibited <xref rid="pone.0014281-Petersen1" ref-type="bibr">[47]</xref>. Therefore, this might explain why a GPP-knockout mutant of <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> is only partially deficient in AsA content <xref rid="pone.0014281-Conklin2" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. Likewise, a greater amount of ascorbate that results from overexpression of purple acid phosphatase AtPAP15 <xref rid="pone.0014281-Zhang1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref> and myo-inositol oxidase <xref rid="pone.0014281-Lorence1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref> may cause a rise in MIPP and the hydrolysis of L-Gal-1-P. This is because myo-inositol cannot be used alone to produce AsA in plants <xref rid="pone.0014281-Hancock2" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. Further study should investigate the functioning and characteristics of <italic>GPP</italic> in plant cells.</p><p>The gene for GGP (VTC2/GDP-L-Gal phosphorylase) also might play an important role in controlling AsA biosynthesis <xref rid="pone.0014281-Linster1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0014281-Bulley1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. Here, <italic>GGP</italic> expression was highest in 30-DAA fruits and then dramatically declined by 45 DAA, after which it remained at a constant level through fruit maturation, as reported by Bulley <italic>et al.</italic>
<xref rid="pone.0014281-Bulley1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. Although this trend was similar to that for AsA content during kiwi fruit development, it did not parallel the rate of AsA accumulation. Ascorbate biosynthesis is the main reason for its accumulation in plant tissue <xref rid="pone.0014281-Hancock2" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>, and its ultimate level is primarily determined by a balance between this synthesis and the oxidation loss of DHA. However, this accumulation only occurs within a certain phase of cellular development &#x02013; in this case, during the young fruit stage, when the capacity is high for synthesis and low for recycling. Here, the rate of accumulation declined from 30 DAA while activities of MDHAR and DHAR, both of which recycle oxidized AsA, began to increase. Expression of GGP was highest at 30 DAA, suggesting that this gene does not control AsA synthesis at the transcript level. Our hypothesis was further supported by the greater expression of GGP in leaf petioles and young leaves, again showing that expression is irrelevant to AsA content. Although transformation methods are effective in elucidating the functions of genes, previous overexpression of GGP to enhance ascorbate content <xref rid="pone.0014281-Bulley1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref> did not demonstrate that it is indeed a regulatory gene for AsA biosynthesis. Overexpression of other pre-step genes in the L-galactose pathway, such as GDP-phosphomannose isomerase <xref rid="pone.0014281-Badejo2" ref-type="bibr">[48]</xref> and phosphomannomutase <xref rid="pone.0014281-Maruta1" ref-type="bibr">[49]</xref>, might increase biosynthesis via a flux change in substrates when applied to transgenic plants. However, overexpression of other genes, e.g., GME, does not lead to altered amounts of ascorbate <xref rid="pone.0014281-Bulley1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref> because its expression alone in plant cells does not meet a minimum flux requirement for AsA biosynthesis.</p><p>MDHAR activity is correlated with AsA levels in tomato fruit under chilling stress <xref rid="pone.0014281-Stevens1" ref-type="bibr">[50]</xref>. It has also been implicated in the increment of DHA <xref rid="pone.0014281-Bermudez1" ref-type="bibr">[51]</xref> as a fruit metabolite locus in tomato. Our results and those of others lend further support to these observations; <italic>MDHAR</italic> transcript and activity levels during fruit development were negatively correlated with AsA and DHA contents. Furthermore, in the later stages of maturation, transcripts and activity of MDHAR began to increase markedly while DHAR activity and its capacity for AsA biosynthesis showed a clear decline. MDHAR might play important roles in maintaining a higher AsA/DHA and in suppressing oxidation losses in kiwi fruits. In fact, that might be a main reason why such fruits exhibit high concentrations of ascorbate even after ripening. Because DHA cannot be reduced to AsA via DHAR, it is further oxidized to 2,3-diketogulonic acid or to non-renewable oxalic acid and/or tartaric acid before being lost <xref rid="pone.0014281-Hancock2" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. Thus, DHAR is important for maintaining AsA levels and a redox state. Here, DHAR activity and the mRNA expression of <italic>DHAR1</italic> and <italic>DHAR2</italic> were greater in the fruit between Days 30 and 75, during which time biosynthetic capacity dramatically declined and MDHAR activity was lower. This demonstrates a complementary relationship between DHAR and MDHAR in maintaining a higher redox state of AsA. However, we found no clear association among AsA content, DHAR activity, and the mRNA expression levels of <italic>DHAR1</italic> and <italic>DHAR2</italic> during fruit development. Those genes also had different expression patterns at various stages of ripening and among tissue types, all of which might have been correlated with certain biological functions or enzyme localization.</p></sec><sec id="s4c"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Ascorbate content in plants is highly regulated by developmental processes that may vary according to genotype, tissues, or cell type. Its biosynthesis is a main reason for its accumulation in many plant tissues, including fruits and conducting tissues. The extent of such accumulation is determined primarily by the balance between its synthesis and the oxidation loss of DHA. Our data indicated that levels of AsA in kiwi fruits are greatest at 30 DAA when it has higher biosynthetic capacity but lower expression and activities of MDHAR and DHAR, and then decrease up to 60 DAA, after which they decline only slightly. Expression of key genes involved in biosynthesis follow trends similar to that for AsA content, the exceptions being <italic>GPP</italic> and post-transcriptionally regulated <italic>GalLDH</italic>. However, GPP has good correlation with the rate of AsA accumulation whereas <italic>GGP</italic> does not. Expression of the latter is greater in leaf petioles and young leaves, both of which contain less ascorbate.</p><p>In conducting tissues, fruit petioles accumulate more AsA but expression is lowest for all but <italic>GalUR3</italic> and <italic>DHAR1</italic>. Using the ethanolic AgNO<sub>3</sub> method, we found a large amount of AsA localized in the microtubules. However, it could not be transported from there into the fruits when exogenous AsA and DHA were added. Meanwhile, AsA distribution was cell-specific in the fruit flesh, with AsA being localized mainly in large cells. Therefore, we believe that <italic>de novo</italic> biosynthesis is the main reason for AsA accumulation in the fruits of cv. Qinmei because ascorbate is not easily transported and deposited into the fruit. In addition, GPP, but not GGP, is a good candidate for controlling AsA production. Studies of the promoters for these genes would bring new insight for the regulatory mechanisms of such biosynthesis in plants. Other future research should focus on degradation, including key factors that control ascorbate levels in apple plants. Of interest would be the extraction of AsA conjugates and functional analyses of the phloem and microtubules.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0014281.s001"><label>Figure S1</label><caption><p>Differences in mRNA expression abundances of genes involved in AsA biosynthesis and recycling.
