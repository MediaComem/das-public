Clinical disease management is hindered by both a lengthy diagnostic process and the absence of effective treatments. Reliable panels of diagnostic, surrogate, and prognostic biomarkers are needed to accelerate disease diagnosis and expedite drug development. The cysteine protease inhibitor cystatin C has recently gained interest as a candidate diagnostic biomarker for ALS, but further studies are required to fully characterize its biomarker utility. We used quantitative enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) to assess initial and longitudinal cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and plasma cystatin C levels in 104 ALS patients and controls. Cystatin C levels in ALS patients were significantly elevated in plasma and reduced in CSF compared to healthy controls, but did not differ significantly from neurologic disease controls. In addition, the direction of longitudinal change in CSF cystatin C levels correlated to the rate of ALS disease progression, and initial CSF cystatin C levels were predictive of patient survival, suggesting that cystatin C may function as a surrogate marker of disease progression and survival. These data verify prior results for reduced cystatin C levels in the CSF of ALS patients, identify increased cystatin C levels in the plasma of ALS patients, and reveal correlations between CSF cystatin C levels to both ALS disease progression and patient survival.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="9"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a fatal neuromuscular disease that affects approximately 1.5 to 2.5 per 100,000 individuals of all races and ethnicities throughout the world <xref rid="pone.0015133-Logroscino1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. ALS patients typically undergo rapid disease progression, though a subset exhibits slow progression and may live over a decade from symptom onset <xref rid="pone.0015133-Louwerse1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0015133-Testa1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. Unfortunately, there is only one drug currently approved by the FDA to treat ALS, and this therapy increases life span by just two to three months on average <xref rid="pone.0015133-Miller1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. Clinical disease management is also hindered by an often lengthy diagnostic process based predominately on clinical criteria <xref rid="pone.0015133-Turner1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. As new drugs that slow or arrest disease progression become available, early initiation of treatment will become paramount. For this reason, diagnostic biomarkers for ALS must be identified and validated to maximize treatment efficacy for future patients. Several individual panels of CSF proteins have shown promise as candidate biomarkers, but none have been fully validated or integrated into clinical practice <xref rid="pone.0015133-Pasinetti1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0015133-Ranganathan1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0015133-Mitchell1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>.</p><p>Biomarkers also hold promise to monitor disease progression and to stratify patient populations for use in clinical trials. One reason new drug therapies have not been successfully translated from ALS model systems to humans is ALS disease heterogeneity <xref rid="pone.0015133-DiBernardo1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. Biomarkers that monitor disease progression would aid in the design and execution of human clinical trials and would provide novel targets for future drug therapies; prognostic biomarkers that predict patient survival would also aid in the design of clinical trials. While there are several validated demographic and clinical prognostic factors for ALS, disease prognosis cannot currently be predicted with high accuracy within individual patients <xref rid="pone.0015133-Chio1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. Ultimately, surrogate biomarkers of disease progression would provide a means to more rapidly monitor drug efficacy in clinical trials <xref rid="pone.0015133-Turner1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0015133-DiBernardo1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0015133-Bowser1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0015133-Wagner1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. Therefore, the search for biomarkers that fit these functional characteristics represents a key challenge toward improving drug therapies and clinical management for ALS.</p><p>One protein that has shown potential for ALS diagnostic utility is cystatin C, a widely expressed cysteine protease inhibitor that is approximately five times more abundant in CSF than in plasma <xref rid="pone.0015133-George1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. Cystatin C is processed through the secretory pathway, and, in its active monomeric form, inhibits a wide variety of cysteine proteases including cathepsins B, H, L, and S, calpains and caspases <xref rid="pone.0015133-Paraoan1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. Cystatin C is also linked to ALS histopathologically, as it is one of only two known proteins that localize to Bunina bodies, which are small intraneuronal inclusions specific to ALS <xref rid="pone.0015133-Okamoto1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>.</p><p>Two prior surface-enhanced laser desorption/ionization time of flight mass spectrometry (SELDI-TOF-MS) studies reported significant decreases in CSF cystatin C levels in ALS patients relative to healthy controls <xref rid="pone.0015133-Pasinetti1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref> and mixed healthy/neurologic disease controls <xref rid="pone.0015133-Ranganathan1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. A recent study using small numbers of test subjects reported a significant reduction in CSF cystatin C concentration in ALS patients relative to individuals with polyneuropathy, as measured by ELISA <xref rid="pone.0015133-TsujiAkimoto1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. While these prior studies are encouraging, a larger study with a more comprehensive group of ALS-mimic disease controls is required in order to verify prior results and determine if CSF cystatin C levels represent a candidate diagnostic biomarker for ALS.</p><p>The objective of this study was to use quantitative ELISA to further evaluate the utility of cystatin C as a biomarker for ALS using a large subject population. Our subject group size was based on power analysis of previously published mass spectrometry reports on cystatin C in ALS <xref rid="pone.0015133-Pasinetti1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0015133-Ranganathan1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. We evaluated cystatin C in both CSF and plasma as a candidate diagnostic biomarker, and correlated levels to individual ALS patient survival and disease progression. We verified that cystatin C protein levels are reduced in the CSF of ALS patients and discovered that cystatin C levels are increased in the plasma of ALS patients. However, cystatin C levels in either biofluid were not highly predictive of ALS. We also determined that CSF cystatin C levels correlate to ALS patient survival, and change during disease progression.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><p>We collected longitudinal CSF and plasma samples from 104 ALS and control subjects (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0015133-t001">Table 1</xref>) and evaluated the absolute cystatin C concentrations by ELISA and the total sample protein concentrations by BCA protein assay. We then assessed the biomarker utility of two separate measures of cystatin C: (1) the absolute cystatin C concentrations or &#x0201c;total cystatin C&#x0201d; and (2) the &#x0201c;percent cystatin C,&#x0201d; in which the absolute cystatin C concentrations were normalized to the total sample protein concentrations to determine the percent of total biofluid protein accounted for by cystatin C.

A less conservative cutoff value of 3.50 &#x000b5;g/ml identified a majority of ALS patients (sensitivity: 52&#x00025;), but demonstrated lower specificity (specificity: 52&#x00025; vs. all study controls, 89&#x00025; vs. mimic disease controls).</p><p>As noted above, cystatin C was previously reported to be significantly reduced in the CSF of ALS patients using mass spectrometry-based proteomics, but the between-group differences based on our ELISA data were less robust.

For these analyses, patients were sorted into high- and low-cystatin C groups according to their first-draw cystatin C levels.

Prior studies using SELDI-TOF-MS found significantly lower cystatin C abundance in the CSF of ALS patients relative to healthy controls <xref rid="pone.0015133-Pasinetti1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref> and mixed healthy/neurologic disease controls <xref rid="pone.0015133-Ranganathan1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. These findings were validated by ELISA and immunoblot, respectively. In our current ELISA study for diagnostic utility using a much larger number of total subjects, we also found a significant reduction in cystatin C levels in the CSF of ALS patients relative to healthy controls, but the magnitude of this difference was less robust than in the previous reports. This discrepancy may have resulted from the use of different experimental techniques, as SELDI-TOF-MS recognizes discrete mass-to-charge forms of cystatin C, whereas ELISA may recognize multiple modified or cleaved forms of cystatin C depending upon the antibodies used for capture and detection. Regarding the comparison of these two techniques, we found a significant, positive correlation but a low correlation coefficient between our CSF ELISA data and SELDI-TOF-MS data for the same samples (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0015133.s001">Figure S1</xref>). This finding suggests that these techniques are sensitive to different, but possibly overlapping, ranges of native cystatin C isoforms, and may provide differential, and perhaps complementary, utility in detecting cystatin C for biomarker assessment.</p><p>To be clinically useful as a diagnostic biomarker, cystatin C must also be able to differentiate between ALS patients and individuals with neurologic diseases that closely resemble ALS, or ALS &#x0201c;mimic diseases.&#x0201d; A recent study reported a significant reduction in CSF cystatin C levels in ALS patients relative to polyneuropathy patients <xref rid="pone.0015133-TsujiAkimoto1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. In our ELISA analysis, cystatin C was reduced in the CSF of ALS patients relative to all DC combined and, to a greater degree, relative to a mimic disease control group that included a variety of ALS mimics (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0015133-t003">Table 3</xref>), but neither difference reached statistical significance. Because these between-group differences were smaller than we expected based on previous mass spectrometry data <xref rid="pone.0015133-Ryberg1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, we conducted a new power analysis using our experimentally-derived group means and standard deviations. This analysis revealed that our study was adequately powered for comparing percent cystatin C between ALS and HC (a significant difference was found), and underpowered for comparing total cystatin C between ALS and HC (main group effects missed significance, but the pairwise comparison was significant), and for comparing ALS with DC for both measures of cystatin C (no significant differences were identified). The observed reductions in both total and percent cystatin C in ALS patients relative to DC may reflect actual differences in clinical cystatin C levels, but a total study enrollment of 1020 and 675 patients (for total and percent cystatin C, respectively) would be required to confirm statistical significance with 80&#x00025; power and 95&#x00025; confidence. Interestingly, the between-group differences and trend towards significance improved when comparing limb-onset ALS patients or ALS patients with disease course greater than 1 year from symptom onset to the ALS mimics (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0015133-t003">Table 3</xref>). Additionally, we found that the total cystatin C concentration measurement generated superior diagnostic accuracy, indicating that this may be the more efficacious measure of cystatin C. An assessment of the diagnostic parameters of CSF cystatin C concentration revealed that the sensitivity of cystatin C for differentiating ALS patients from disease controls is low for all cutoff values but it displays high levels of specificity and, therefore, cystatin C can only identify a small subset of ALS patients. Together, these findings indicate that CSF cystatin C levels may differ between ALS patients and relevant disease control populations but cystatin C, by itself, has limited diagnostic utility. However, this protein could potentially improve the sensitivity and/or specificity of a diagnostic biomarker panel. Due to the heterogeneous nature of the ALS patient population, it is likely that a multiple biomarker panel will be required, as opposed to any single protein biomarker, in order to differentiate ALS from related disorders with adequate diagnostic certainty <xref rid="pone.0015133-SeronieVivien1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>.</p><p>We also assessed the diagnostic utility of plasma cystatin C levels. Plasma cystatin C has been extensively characterized as a peripheral biomarker for kidney function and as a prognostic indicator of the risk of morbidity and mortality relating to cardiovascular disease <xref rid="pone.0015133-Madero1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0015133-Ryberg2" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. However, blood-borne levels of cystatin C have not been evaluated as a biomarker candidate for neurologic disorders. We found that plasma cystatin C levels are equivalently elevated in both ALS patients and disease controls relative to healthy controls, indicating that elevated plasma cystatin C is a nonspecific finding associated with neurologic disease states. Therefore, plasma cystatin C levels, as evaluated by ELISA, do not to have diagnostic utility for ALS. Furthermore, the absence of a relationship between cystatin C levels in concurrently-drawn CSF and plasma samples from individual patients in this study (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0015133.s002">Figure S2</xref>) suggests that this protein is independently regulated in each biofluid. Accordingly, plasma cystatin C levels are unlikely to be directly correlated with motor neuron degeneration in ALS, though elevated levels may correlate to peripheral metabolic or inflammatory abnormalities during ALS.</p><p>A recent study examined a single CSF draw per ALS patient, taken at varying times from symptom onset, to indirectly infer the average longitudinal change in cystatin C concentration in the group as a whole, and they reported that cystatin C levels do not change over time <xref rid="pone.0015133-TsujiAkimoto1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. We completed a similar analysis and also found no evidence for a patterned directional change in CSF cystatin C levels over time in ALS patients (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0015133-g001">Figure 1</xref>). However, both heterogeneity in disease progression speed and individual variation in baseline cystatin C levels could mask significant trends in cystatin C change over the course of disease progression and, therefore, single-draw protein levels are unsuitable for a thorough assessment of longitudinal trends in cystatin C abundance.</p><p>We also examined longitudinal CSF data from multiple patients to more accurately assess the changes in cystatin C over time. We found that longitudinal cystatin C concentrations were relatively constant in ALS patients as a combined group. In contrast, the subgroup of patients with slow or absent clinical disease progression exhibited longitudinal increases in cystatin C concentration, and the subgroup with more typical, continuous clinical deterioration exhibited longitudinal decreases in total cystatin C. Interestingly, slow progressors often exhibited lower initial levels of CSF cystatin C than fast progressors (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0015133-t005">Table 5</xref>). Similar trends were also observed for percent cystatin C measurements, but statistical significance was not reached. These results indicate that CSF cystatin C levels in ALS patients change over time in a clinically-relevant manner and that increasing cystatin C concentration may be associated with slower disease progression. Conversely, rapid disease progression may be associated with a decrease in cystatin C concentration over time.</p><p>We also conducted an analysis to determine the relationship between longitudinal changes in CSF cystatin C levels and time-matched changes in three functional clinical measures of disease progression (ALSFRS-R, MMT, and FVC). However, no significant correlations were found (data not shown). This indicates that cystatin C levels may change independently of the clinical parameters used for monitoring disease progression. However, this finding does not eliminate the possibility that changes in CSF cystatin C levels correlate with more subtle biochemical changes associated with disease progression, as these may not be accurately reflected by overt functional measures of clinical disease status <xref rid="pone.0015133-DiBernardo1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0015133-Bowser1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. Furthermore, the observed trend of increasing cystatin C levels in patients with slow rates of clinical deterioration may prove to be useful as an objective biomarker for monitoring drug effects in clinical trials.</p><p>We recently demonstrated a correlation between CSF cystatin C levels and patient survival by SELDI-TOF-MS <xref rid="pone.0015133-Ryberg1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. In this study, we further verified a direct correlation between CSF cystatin C concentration and patient survival time, supporting the potential utility of this protein for prognostic applications. Subsequent Kaplan-Meier survival analyses for patient groups with CSF cystatin C concentrations above and below qualitatively selected cut-off values confirmed significantly longer survival times for patients in the higher cystatin C groups. Additionally, the prognostic capacity of CSF cystatin C was higher for limb-onset patients (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0015133-g002">Figure 2B</xref>) than for all patients combined (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0015133-g002">Figure 2A</xref>). This may have resulted from the confounding effects of combining patients with different sites of disease onset, as bulbar-onset ALS patients typically have shorter survival times than limb-onset patients <xref rid="pone.0015133-Louwerse1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0015133-Testa1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. Unfortunately, there were inadequate numbers of bulbar-, trunk-, and/or dementia-onset patients to analyze these individual subgroups in this study, and further analyses are required to determine the prognostic capacity of cystatin C in these subgroups. Nonetheless, these results show that cystatin C is a candidate prognostic indicator of survival in ALS patients. Alternatively, cystatin C levels could contribute to the process of balancing prognostic variables among experimental groups as recommended to equalize drop-out rates and preserve the balancing effects of randomization in clinical trials <xref rid="pone.0015133-DiBernardo1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. Further work is required to more fully characterize the relationship between CSF cystatin C concentration and ALS patient survival, and to determine optimal cut-off values and procedures to stratify patients for prognostic purposes.</p><p>The results of this comprehensive biomarker assessment also have implications for the potential mechanistic involvement of cystatin C in the pathogenesis of ALS. The function of cystatin C within the CNS has not been extensively studied, but it appears to have both neurotoxic and neuroprotective properties <xref rid="pone.0015133-Nagai1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0015133-Nagai2" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0015133-Xu1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0015133-Nishiyama1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>, though its effects specifically on motor neurons have not been reported. The majority of cystatin C in the CSF is produced by the choroid plexus <xref rid="pone.0015133-Tu1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>, but it is unclear whether the apparent reductions in CSF levels in ALS patients are an independent etiological factor contributing to motor neuron degeneration, a downstream result of disease pathogenesis, or a compensatory response to ALS pathology. However, the association of higher cystatin C concentrations with longer patient survival and the association of increasing cystatin C levels with slower clinical progression both suggest that extracellular cystatin C may exhibit neuroprotective properties within the context of ALS. This would implicate any absolute or relative cystatin C deficiency in ALS as both a potential contributor to disease pathogenesis and a potential therapeutic target. Continuing work in our laboratory is focused on determining the effects of altered cystatin C concentration/activity on motor neurons <italic>in vitro</italic>, in order to clarify its potential mechanistic role in ALS pathogenesis.</p><p>In summary, we have completed a comprehensive evaluation of cystatin C as a candidate ALS biomarker, including assessments of two complementary measures of cystatin C in two distinct biofluids as well as examinations of both longitudinal CSF samples and patient survival data. Our findings indicate that cystatin C levels, as determined by ELISA, are increased in the plasma and decreased in the CSF of ALS patients relative to healthy controls. CSF cystatin C measurements may possess a more limited diagnostic capacity for ALS than previously proposed, but may still have the potential to improve the diagnostic parameters of a biomarker panel. Additionally, longitudinal changes in CSF cystatin C levels may be useful as a biomarker of fast versus slow rates of disease progression. Our data also demonstrate that CSF cystatin C concentration has prognostic utility in estimating patient survival time. Further validation studies are necessary to confirm these findings and ultimately determine if cystatin C measurements can be used to enhance clinical disease management and clinical trial design. Finally, the association of high or increasing cystatin C levels with slower disease progression and increased survival time suggests a potential neuroprotective role for this protein in the pathobiology of ALS.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Sample Collection and Ethics Statement</title><p>This study was approved by the institutional review board (IRB) at the University of Pittsburgh, and written informed consent was obtained from all participating subjects. ALS subjects were diagnosed by experienced neurologists specialized in motor neuron disease, using revised El Escorial criteria <xref rid="pone.0015133-Brooks1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. CSF and plasma samples were collected at the same office visit every four to six months from 44 ALS patients (2&#x02013;8 draws), and either once or twice (1.5&#x02013;2 years apart) from 35 non-neurologic healthy controls (HC) and 25 neurologic disease controls (DC). Our total enrollment of 104 patients provided adequate power for this study as a pre-study power analysis using projected effect sizes based on previous mass spectrometry findings <xref rid="pone.0015133-Ryberg1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref> concluded that a total enrollment of 96 patients was required to identify pairwise differences between ALS patients and both HC and DC groups for both measures of cystatin C. We did not control for potential confounding variables such as socioeconomic status, nutrition, environmental exposures, etc. between diagnostic groups. The median time from symptom onset to first draw for ALS patients was 468 days. Clinical parameters used to monitor ALS disease progression included the rate of change in the revised ALS functional rating scale (ALSFRS-R), manual muscle strength tests (MMT), and forced vital capacity (FVC) <xref rid="pone.0015133-Magnus1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0015133-Cedarbaum1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0015133-Sorensen1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>.</p><p>The disease control group included six patients with multiple sclerosis, one with bilateral facial palsies, one with neurosarcoidosis, one with viral encephalitis, one with CNS lymphoma, one with brain metastases, one with pseudotumor cerebri, one with a seizure disorder, one with complicated migraine, one with paresthesis and possible myelopathy, one with a probable conversion disorder, and nine with neurologic diseases that can clinically resemble ALS at presentation. This ALS-mimic disease subgroup included two patients with primary lateral sclerosis (PLS), two with chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP), two with progressive muscular atrophy, one with spinocerebellar ataxia, one with small fiber neuropathy, and one with idiopathic sensorimotor polyneuropathy. CSF samples were obtained by lumbar puncture, immediately centrifuged at 450 g for five minutes at 4&#x000b0;C to remove cells and debris, aliquoted, and then frozen at &#x02212;80&#x000b0;C. Intravenous blood samples were collected in EDTA containing tubes, inverted to mix, and centrifuged at 1,733 g for 10 min at 4&#x000b0;C. The plasma was decanted, aliquoted, and frozen at &#x02212;80&#x000b0;C. CSF and plasma were aliquoted into small volumes for single use in experiments in order to eliminate any freeze/thaw effects.

All samples were independently assayed at least twice. For all experiments, we used a human cystatin C sandwich ELISA kit (Biovendor, Candler, NC), according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, diluted CSF and plasma samples (1&#x02236;2000 and 1&#x02236;400, respectively in dilution buffer) were applied to antibody pre-coated ELISA plates for 30 min with gentle agitation. The wells were washed thoroughly and then the secondary antibody conjugate solution was applied for 30 min with gentle agitation. After a second wash, the 3,3&#x02032;,5,5&#x02032; Tetramethylbenzidine substrate solution (Biovendor, Candler, NC) was applied for 10 min, color development was stopped with an acidic stop solution, and the optical density was measured at 450 nm using a plate reader.

The data points were averaged to determine the absolute cystatin C concentration, or &#x0201c;total cystatin C,&#x0201d; for each sample.
