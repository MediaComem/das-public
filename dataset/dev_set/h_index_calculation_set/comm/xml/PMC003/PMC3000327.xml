In crustaceans, male sexual differentiation is controlled by the male-specific androgenic gland (AG). An AG-specific insulin-like gene, previously identified in the red-claw crayfish <italic>Cherax quadricarinatus</italic> (designated <italic>Cq-IAG</italic>), was found in this study to be the prominent transcript in an AG cDNA subtractive library. In <italic>C. quadricarinatus</italic>, sexual plasticity is exhibited by intersex individuals in the form of an active male reproductive system and male secondary sex characters, along with a constantly arrested ovary. This intersexuality was exploited to follow changes caused by single gene silencing, accomplished via dsRNA injection. <italic>Cq-IAG</italic> silencing induced dramatic sex-related alterations, including male feature feminization, a reduction in sperm production, extensive testicular degeneration, expression of the <italic>vitellogenin</italic> gene, and accumulation of yolk proteins in the developing oocytes. Upon silencing of the gene, AG cells hypertrophied, possibly to compensate for low hormone levels, as reflected in the poor production of the insulin-like hormone (and revealed by immunohistochemistry). These results demonstrate both the functionality of <italic>Cq-IAG</italic> as an androgenic hormone-encoding gene and the dependence of male gonad viability on the Cq-IAG product. This study is the first to provide evidence that silencing an insulin-like gene in intersex <italic>C. quadricarinatus</italic> feminizes male-related phenotypes. These findings, moreover, contribute to the understanding of the regulation of sexual shifts, whether naturally occurring in sequential hermaphrodites or abnormally induced by endocrine disruptors found in the environment, and offer insight into an unusual gender-related link to the evolution of insulins.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="10"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Understanding sexual shifts and differentiation in both vertebrates and invertebrates is of major interest, particularly given our changing environment. In vertebrates, such as fish, the regulation of such processes can be attributed not only to genetics but also to the effects of hormones and/or environmental factors <xref rid="pone.0015281-Kloas1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0015281-Kokokiris1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. In invertebrates, too, diverse factors are involved in the regulation of sexual differentiation. For example, in arthropods, such as <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>, gender-biased alternative splicing constitutes an important component of sexual differentiation <xref rid="pone.0015281-TelonisScott1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. Although crustaceans are also considered to be Arthropoda and even believed to be potential ancestors of insects <xref rid="pone.0015281-Glenner1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, these ancient marine organisms demonstrate regulation of sexual differentiation that is significantly different from that of insects. In Crustacea, the process is governed by the androgenic gland (AG) <xref rid="pone.0015281-CharniauxCotton1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, an endocrine gland restricted to males that secretes male sex hormone(s) <xref rid="pone.0015281-CharniauxCotton2" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. It is believed that female sexual development and secondary characteristics are exhibited only in the absence of the AG, thereby establishing femaleness as a matter of default, negatively regulated by the AG <xref rid="pone.0015281-CharniauxCotton3" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. In crustaceans, AG involvement in inducing masculinity has been thoroughly investigated in several species <xref rid="pone.0015281-Suzuki1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0015281-Taketomi1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. In the Australian red-claw crayfish, <italic>Cherax quadricarinatus</italic>, the implantation of AGs into immature females led to the replacement of female characteristics with male traits, as well as to the cessation of vitellogenesis <xref rid="pone.0015281-Khalaila1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0015281-Manor1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>.</p><p>The vast array of observed AG-associated effects has been attributed to an AG-borne hormone. Three orthologs of this putative AG hormone have been isolated from three species of isopods <xref rid="pone.0015281-Ohira1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0015281-Okuno1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. Recently, two uniquely AG-expressed genes were revealed using AG cDNA libraries prepared from the decapods, <italic>C. quadricarinatus</italic> (<italic>Cq-IAG</italic>) and the freshwater prawn, <italic>Macrobrachium rosenbergii</italic> (<italic>Mr-IAG</italic>) <xref rid="pone.0015281-Manor2" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0015281-Ventura1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. Structurally, both sequences resemble genes of the insulin-like superfamily <xref rid="pone.0015281-Manor2" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. Although evidence supporting a role for insulin in sexual differentiation has been previously documented <xref rid="pone.0015281-Nef1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, the unique instance of a gender-specific insulin-like gene has thus far been reported exclusively in crustaceans. Thus, it is possible that insulins may have evolved in the context of regulation of sexual differentiation and not exclusively on the background of metabolism and growth.</p><p>AG hormone ineffectiveness, whether induced by AG ablation or resulting naturally from insufficient levels of secreted hormone(s), can account for hermaphroditism, as was suggested previously to explain part of a sexual shift in a protandric amphipod <xref rid="pone.0015281-CharniauxCotton4" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. Generally, intersexuality in sequential hermaphrodites involves a short transition state in which an individual exhibits sex characteristics of both genders. Such sexual intermediacy may also be abnormally induced by chemicals, collectively termed endocrine disruptors. In contrast to the above-described transient intersexuality, <italic>C. quadricarinatus</italic>, a gonochoristic species demonstrating distinct males and females, experiences non-transient intersexuality <xref rid="pone.0015281-Thorn1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. This phenomenon has been found in both wild and cultured populations at frequencies ranging from 2&#x02013;14&#x00025; <xref rid="pone.0015281-Abdu1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>.The intersex individuals are genetic females but functional males <xref rid="pone.0015281-Parnes1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>, bearing an active male reproductive system and male secondary sex characters, along with a constantly arrested ovary <xref rid="pone.0015281-Sagi1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>, possibly due to the presence of the AG. It has been shown that upon AG ablation, intersex <italic>C. quadricarinatus</italic> undergo a dramatic morphological and physiological sex shift in which male reproductive organs regress, accompanied by ovarian activation and the onset of vitellogenesis <xref rid="pone.0015281-Khalaila2" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0015281-Sagi2" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0015281-Sagi3" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. Thus, monitoring vitellogenin, an egg yolk precursor protein, in this intersex species could serve as an accurate physiological indicator of sexual shifts <xref rid="pone.0015281-Manor1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0015281-Sagi3" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>.</p><p>Although sexual shifts have been documented in invertebrates <xref rid="pone.0015281-Bauer1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0015281-Brook1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>, the physiological mechanisms controlling these events are not fully understood. In these complicated processes, the production of gametes according to the primary gender is stopped, while the ability to produce germ cells of the opposite sex is acquired. Hence, it is probable that in such sexual shifts, the cell population of the gonad is replaced through repopulation with &#x02018;new&#x02019; gonia, following the programmed degradation of the &#x02018;old&#x02019; gonia via apoptosis. Indeed, apoptosis is responsible for the differentiation of the primordial gonad en route to the testis in zebrafish <xref rid="pone.0015281-Uchida1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>, and several anti-apoptotic factors have already been identified as being crucial for the survival of male rat germ cells <xref rid="pone.0015281-Kawamura1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>.</p><p>The discovery of the first decapod AG-specific gene in <italic>C. quadricarinatus</italic>, <italic>Cq-IAG</italic>
<xref rid="pone.0015281-Manor2" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, provided a new route for studying crayfish sexuality. Still, the functionality and presumed involvement of <italic>Cq-IAG</italic> in sexual differentiation has yet to be determined. Gene silencing using RNAi offers one strategy to address such questions. This approach has been successful in several crustaceans <xref rid="pone.0015281-Ventura1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0015281-Lugo1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>. In the current study, we employ a functional genomics assay that relies on dsRNA silencing of <italic>Cq-IAG</italic> in an intersex model to demonstrate an inducible sex shift. Specifically, male external sex characters were transformed to generate animals that exhibited female maternal care-related traits, along with testicular degeneration and AG hypertrophy (hAG). In parallel, ovarian activation was observed as the result of the onset of vitellogenesis. These findings confirm the pivotal role of <italic>Cq-IAG</italic> in the regulation of sexual differentiation in <italic>C. quadricarinatus</italic>. Significantly, elucidation of the role of this gene in <italic>C. quadricarinatus</italic> might contribute to understanding of the evolution of the control of processes regulating sexual shifts in protandrous crustaceans and may provide unique insight into the gender-related evolution of members of the insulin superfamily.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><p>The isolation of <italic>Cq-IAG</italic>, accomplished via the construction of an AG cDNA library, has been described previously <xref rid="pone.0015281-Manor2" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. In the present study, a further screening was conducted. A colony hybridization, which was used to eliminate <italic>Cq-IAG</italic> ESTs from subsequent sequencing, showed that 115 out of 508 colonies were positive for <italic>Cq-IAG</italic>. This result, showing that <italic>Cq-IAG</italic> comprises approximately 25&#x00025; of the ESTs, is with accordance with the previous screening of the library.

However, no new genes were identified and thus no further screening was conducted.</p><p>A prerequisite for a long <italic>in-vivo</italic> assay demonstrating the functionality of <italic>Cq-IAG</italic> was to evaluate the effectiveness of gene knock-down via RNAi.

The efficiency of injected <italic>Cq-IAG</italic> dsRNA in reducing <italic>Cq-IAG</italic> expression was revealed by real-time RT-PCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0015281-g001">Fig. 1</xref>).

Silencing of the gene in young intersex animals induced the appearance of maternal care-related secondary sex characteristics. Comparing control intersex crayfish (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0015281-g002">Fig. 2A</xref>) with dsRNA-injected animals revealed increases in the width and length of the endopodite (i.e., the internal branch of the swimming leg) <xref rid="pone.0015281-Sagi1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0015281-g002">Fig. 2B</xref>).

<italic>Cq-IAG</italic> belongs to the insulin-like superfamily of genes, which are generally assigned to processes of metabolism and growth. However, some insulin growth factors are also linked to differentiation and apoptosis <xref rid="pone.0015281-Lelbach1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>. The rare case of <italic>Cq-IAG</italic> and several other AG-specific insulin-like genes, which are expressed in a gender-specific manner restricted to males, has been thus far recorded exclusively in Crustacea <xref rid="pone.0015281-Ohira1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0015281-Ventura1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. Sequence conservation among crustacean AG-specific insulin-like peptides is relatively low (approximately 16&#x02013;29&#x00025;), considering their putative central role as male sex hormones. However, their predicted structures are quite similar and conserved, comprising heterodimeric peptide chains, resulting from the proteolysis of the pro-hormone. Moreover, the various versions of the peptide share the exact same positions of cysteine residues, which govern folding via the formation of disulfide bonds. Our results regarding the induction of femaleness, combined with the demasculinization of male prawn <italic>M. rosenbergii</italic>
<xref rid="pone.0015281-Ventura1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, both achieved by the silencing of AG-specific insulin-like genes, indicate that insulin-like genes have evolved not only in the context of metabolism and growth but also in the context of male sex differentiation. However, in substantial difference from the prawn, the present study, addressing an intersex crayfish, suggests that in addition to the induction of maleness, the AG-specific insulin-like factor serves as a gender switcher that controls the maleness/femaleness balance in an intersex organism. This concept gives rise to a hypothesis linking AG-specific insulin-like factors to the regulation of sexual shifts in crustacean sequential hermaphrodites. Although insulin-like genes have been documented in the context of insect sexuality <xref rid="pone.0015281-Belgacem1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>, proliferation and growth <xref rid="pone.0015281-Nakahara1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0015281-Nijhout1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>, no evidence of a gender-specific insulin-like gene has previously been recorded in this taxonomic group. The fact that such a gender-specific insulin-like gene, playing a pivotal role in crustacean sexual differentiation, does not exist in insects is somewhat puzzling, since crustaceans are considered to be evolutionarily older than insects <xref rid="pone.0015281-Glenner1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>.</p><p>An important observation of the present study is the extensive AG hypertrophy seen following <italic>Cq-IAG</italic> silencing, a procedure that led to low transcription and poor production of the proteinaceous hormone encoded by the <italic>Cq-IAG</italic> gene. It is thus suggested that the AG-specific insulin-like factor Cq-IAG may, therefore, regulate its own production and secretion by means of feedback inhibition. Thus, the hybridization of <italic>Cq-IAG</italic> mRNA with the exogenous <italic>Cq-IAG</italic> dsRNA, which led to the degradation of the corresponding mRNA, permitted only basal levels of protein production and possibly induced compensation, leading to hypertrophy. We cannot rule out the possibility that higher hierarchy levels of regulation (e.g. paracrine and/or endocrine) could possibly also regulate AG activity, thereby inducing the observed hypertrophy, since hypertrophy of a gland in compensation for low levels of secreted product is well documented in cases of endocrine deficiencies <xref rid="pone.0015281-Biondi1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>.</p><p>This study rests on the sexual plastic model of intersexuality as the basis for elucidating the role of the AG-specific insulin-like gene in <italic>C. quadricarinatus</italic> and its involvement in sexual regulation. <italic>Cq-IAG</italic> silencing in the intersex crayfish clearly revealed the involvement of this gene in maintaining maleness, as reflected in the empty vas deference and arrest of spermatogenesis that resulted from knock-down of <italic>Cq-IAG</italic> levels. Moreover, the extensive degeneration of the testicular lobules observed indicates that Cq-IAG is essential for male germ cell survival. Such involvement of an insulin-like peptide in testicular germ cell survival has also been documented in rats <xref rid="pone.0015281-Kawamura1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>. Moreover, the effect of Cq-IAG in extending the viability of male germ cells is similar to that seen with the mammalian male sex hormone, testosterone <xref rid="pone.0015281-Nandi1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>, under similar circumstances. Such resemblance implies that Cq-IAG acts in an androgenic way, being required for male gonad differentiation and ongoing spermatogenesis. Importantly, in silenced intersex <italic>C. quadricarinatus</italic> individuals, male regression occurred simultaneously with ovarian activation and the onset of vitellogenesis, suggesting that a prerequisite for the activation of femaleness is a lack of sufficient levels of the AG factor, which in turn leads to apoptosis and degeneration of the male gonad and sexual shift. The results of this study, which are in accordance with previous ones <xref rid="pone.0015281-Ventura1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref> and which demonstrate the effect of an insulin-like gene on male sexuality, are based on loss of function experimentation. Moreover, in a gain of function study using a recombinant protein based on the orthologous AG-specific insulin-like gene in females of the isopod <italic>A. vulgare</italic>
<xref rid="pone.0015281-Okuno2" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>, the induction of masculinity was documented, thus suggesting a direct role for this AG family of genes in governing masculinity. Such a direct effect of an AG-specific insulin-like peptide using recombinant proteins has not been shown in decapods as yet. Due to the lack of such direct evidence, secondary/indirect regulation of masculine differentiation by an AG-specific insulin-like peptide cannot be ruled out.</p><p>The sexual shift induced in this study upon manipulation of a single AG gene may provide, for the first time, insight into the mechanisms underlying sexual shifts that occur naturally in many sequential hermaphrodites in the animal kingdom <xref rid="pone.0015281-Warner1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>, particularly in protandric hermaphrodite crustaceans. While the endocrine mechanism underlying this phenomenon is not yet known, our results suggest that in protandric hermaphrodite crustaceans, a single insulin-like gene is involved in the regulation of the sexual shift. Our findings also allow us to posit that such an insulin-like gene sustains maleness in early life, followed by intrinsic silencing later on, which triggers sex inversion towards femaleness via an intersexual transition state.</p><p>The building of a comprehensive picture of the processes of natural sexual shift opens the window for study of abnormal processes of sexuality. Such cases can be induced by man-made environmental pollutants that act as endocrine disruptors <xref rid="pone.0015281-Olmstead1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>. How these substances induce sex abnormalities remains to be elucidated. Thus, addressing mechanisms in naturally occurring sequential hermaphroditism, such as the AG and the secreted insulin-like peptide studied here, could serve to elucidate pathways inducing sex abnormalities in crustaceans, with possible extrapolation to other arthropods. Such insight carries significant applied implications, such as in the possibility of creating non-breeding, all-male crustacean populations <xref rid="pone.0015281-Aflalo1" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref> via AG-specific insulin-like gene manipulation.

For the immunohistochemistry, paraffin sections of AGs obtained from endocrinologically induced <xref rid="pone.0015281-Khalaila1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref> and dsRNA-injected intersex animals were deparaffinized and rehydrated. Sections were then incubated in citrate buffer (0.5 M, pH 6, 30 min in 95&#x000b0;C) for antigen retrieval and washed in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) (10 mM, pH 7.4). Blocking (2&#x00025; normal goat serum, 0.1&#x00025; Triton X 100, 0.05&#x00025; Tween 20 in PBS) lasted for 1 h at room temperature, followed by incubation with the primary Cq-IAG antibody (1&#x02236;10,000). Slides were washed in PBS and incubated with a secondary goat anti-rabbit FITC conjugate antibody (1&#x02236;500 in PBS with 0.2&#x00025; fish skin gelatin) for 1 h at room temperature. After PBS washes, slides were mounted (DAPI 1&#x02236;1000 in PBS and 50&#x00025; glycerol) and imaged using a confocal microscope.</p></sec><sec id="s4i"><title>Anatomical, morphological and physiological measurements</title><p>The first left pleopod was removed from all intersex individuals at the beginning of the experiment, and the newly regenerated pleopod was removed at the end of the experiment.

The type of setation on the inner side of the endopod was observed by using a light microscope with an objective micrometer. The average diameter of 15 randomly selected oocytes from each ovary was determined under a light microscope with an objective micrometer (x40, &#x000b1;25 &#x000b5;m). Similarly, the average diameter of 15 randomly selected nuclei of cross-sectioned silenced and control AGs were also determined (x1000, &#x000b1;1 &#x000b5;m).

Due to the nature of the experiment the analyzed groups were relatively small and not normally distributed. Thus, non-parametric tests had to be used. All statistical analyses of a single parameter compared between 2 groups (e.g. EWI, oocytes diameter and AG nuclei diameter) were analyzed using the Mann Whitney U Test. The three and four groups analyzed in the real time RT-PCR and ELISA experimentation, respectively, were analyzed using the Kruskal Wallis Test followed by the correction of a multiple pair-wise comparison (built-in within the STATISTICA software) as accepted. We took into account that some groups might differ only in a marginally significant manner due to the usage of a multiple non-parametric test, which relies on a ranking principle.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><p>We gratefully thank Mr. Shahar Shimshon for his technical assistance and Mr. Yossi Ben of Beer Tzofar for supplying the animals for the study.
