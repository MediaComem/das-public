<italic>Pneumocystis jirovecii</italic> remains an important cause of fatal pneumonia (<italic>Pneumocystis</italic> pneumonia or PcP) in HIV&#x0002b; patients and other immunocompromised hosts. Despite many previous attempts, a clinically useful serologic test for <italic>P. jirovecii</italic> infection has never been developed.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/Principal Findings</title><p>We analyzed serum antibody responses to the <italic>P. jirovecii</italic> major surface glycoprotein recombinant fragment C1 (MsgC1) in 110 HIV&#x0002b; patients with active PcP (cases) and 63 HIV&#x0002b; patients with pneumonia due to other causes (controls) by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The cases had significantly higher IgG and IgM antibody levels to MsgC1 than the controls at hospital admission (week 0) and intervals up to at least 1 month thereafter. The sensitivity, specificity and positive predictive value (PPV) of IgG antibody levels increased from 57.2&#x00025;, 61.7&#x00025; and 71.5&#x00025; at week 0 to 63.4&#x00025;, 100&#x00025;, and 100&#x00025;, respectively, at weeks 3&#x02013;4. The sensitivity, specificity and PPV of IgM antibody levels rose from 59.7&#x00025;, 61.3&#x00025;, and 79.3&#x00025; at week 0 to 74.6&#x00025;, 73.7&#x00025;, and 89.8&#x00025;, respectively, at weeks 3&#x02013;4.

<italic>Pneumocystis jirovecii</italic> pneumonia (PcP) was the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in HIV&#x0002b; patients early in the HIV/AIDS epidemic <xref rid="pone.0014259-Morris1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0014259-Walzer1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. With the introduction and wide use of highly active antiretroviral therapy (ART) and PcP chemoprophylaxis, the incidence of PcP in this patient population has declined. However, PcP remains an important clinical problem in HIV&#x0002b; and other immunocompromised patients with mortality rates ranging from 10&#x02013;60&#x00025; depending on the underlying disease <xref rid="pone.0014259-Krajicek1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0014259-Walzer1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>.</p><p>Definitive diagnosis of PcP is usually made by the microscopic demonstration of the organism in specimens obtained by induced sputum or bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) with histological or immunofluorescent reagents <xref rid="pone.0014259-Thomas1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. Often, HIV&#x0002b; patients with a suggestive clinical picture of PcP are treated empirically for PcP <xref rid="pone.0014259-Rimland1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. In such cases, non-invasive and non-specific methods such as chest radiographs, serum lactic dehydrogenase (LDH), or serum &#x003b2;-glucan levels may be used to help support the diagnosis <xref rid="pone.0014259-Tasaka1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0014259-Pisculli1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. Detection of <italic>P. jirovecii</italic> DNA by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is highly sensitive; however, this test is not commercially available, and the high rate of <italic>P. jirovecii</italic> colonization in HIV&#x0002b; patients can make PCR results difficult to interpret <xref rid="pone.0014259-Davis1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>.</p><p>The availability of a reliable and sensitive serological test for <italic>P. jirovecii</italic> infection, particularly if it involved only a single specimen, is attractive because it would provide a degree of specificity to currently available non-invasive tests described above. Serologic studies have been investigated for many years, but the reagents used could not reliably distinguish present from past <italic>P. jirovecii</italic> infection or colonization from active disease <xref rid="pone.0014259-Peglow1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0014259-Walzer2" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. Since <italic>Pneumocystis</italic> cannot be reliably grown in vitro, it has been difficult to obtain large quantities of purified proteins for use as antigens for assay development.</p><p>Recently, recombinant antigens of <italic>P. jirovecii</italic> have been developed that show promise as reagents for serologic studies: Kexin 1, which is encoded by a single gene; the major surface glycoprotein (Msg), which is encoded by multiple genes and is capable of antigenic variation <xref rid="pone.0014259-Garbe1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0014259-Kutty1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. Both antigens are highly immunogenic and contain protective epitopes <xref rid="pone.0014259-Walzer2" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0014259-Stringer1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. We have focused our attention on Msg. First we developed 3 overlapping recombinant fragments (MsgA, MsgB, MsgC1) that span the entire length of a single Msg isoform for our studies <xref rid="pone.0014259-Daly1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0014259-Daly2" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. Then we developed variants (MsgC 3, 8, and 9) of Msg C1 in order to better define the reactivity of serum antibodies <xref rid="pone.0014259-Daly3" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>.</p><p>We have shown that MsgC1 is helpful in distinguishing HIV&#x0002b; patients who have had previous PcP from those who did not and in differentiating healthcare workers who had contact with patients from those who did not <xref rid="pone.0014259-Daly1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0014259-Daly2" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0014259-Tipirneni1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. We also examined the serologic responses to <italic>P. jirovecii</italic> infection in early childhood; geographic differences in seroreactivity to MsgC1; and the specific factors independently related to high antibody levels to MsgC1 in long-term cohort study <xref rid="pone.0014259-Daly4" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0014259-Walzer3" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>. In addition, we conducted a pilot study to examine the serologic responses in HIV&#x0002b; patients admitted to the San Francisco General Hospital (SFGH) with PcP (cases) and pneumonia due other causes (controls) <xref rid="pone.0014259-Daly5" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>. The data showed that first episode of PcP and CD4&#x0002b; counts &#x02265;50 cells/&#x000b5;L were the principal host factors associated with a rise in antibody response to MsgC1. While this report was of interest, it was limited by the relatively small number of cases and lack of convalescent serum specimens in the controls. In addition, the study only examined IgG antibodies and provided only modest information about the influence host factors had on these antibodies.</p><p>Since the pilot study, we have increased the number of SFGH HIV&#x0002b; cases and controls with acute and convalescent serum specimens. We have also improved the IgG assay and developed an assay to measure IgM antibody responses to MsgC1. We undertook the present study to: 1) characterize the IgG and IgM antibody responses to MsgC1 in the cases and the controls; 2) evaluate these antibody responses in the diagnosis of PcP; and 3) identify specific host or environmental factors associated with these antibodies. The data show that there are significant differences in IgG and IgM levels between cases and controls at multiple time points, which suggest that this serologic test may be helpful in the diagnosis of PcP.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Patient population</title><p>The study was approved by the University of California San Francisco and the University of Cincinnati Institutional Review Boards, and all patients provided written, informed consent for participation in the study. As standard clinical practice, all HIV&#x0002b; patients admitted to SFGH with respiratory symptoms were evaluated by a uniform diagnostic protocol previously described <xref rid="pone.0014259-Huang1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>. The diagnosis of PcP was confirmed by visualization of the organism in induced sputum or bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) specimen (cases) using Diff-Quik stain, which is a modified Giemsa stain, which identifies all stages of the <italic>Pneumocystis</italic> life cycle. Patients whose specimens were negative for <italic>P. jirovecii</italic> served as controls. From May 2000 to May 2008, 173 HIV&#x0002b; subjects (110 cases, 63 controls) were enrolled. Among the 63 controls, 45 (71.4&#x00025;) had community acquired pneumonia (CAP), 7 (11.1&#x00025;) had mycobacterial diseases (2 with tuberculosis and 5 with <italic>Mycobacterium avium</italic> complex (MAC)), and 7 (11.1&#x00025;) had other diseases such as pulmonary Kaposi sarcoma, bronchitis, pulmonary fibrosis, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Four patients had no discharge diagnosis listed in chart abstraction. Seven of the patients with CAP had bacteria cultured in sputum and 2 had MAC isolated in sputum.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Data collection</title><p>At hospital admission, clinical and demographic (age, gender, race) characteristics were collected <xref rid="pone.0014259-Daly5" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0014259-Huang1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>. The clinical data collected were history of PcP, CD4&#x0002b; counts, plasma HIV viral load, serum LDH level, serum albumin levels, arterial blood gas measurements and the use of mechanical ventilation. The use of PcP prophylaxis within the last 3 months and PcP treatment provided were also collected. An acute-phase serum specimen was drawn at the time of hospital admission and convalescent-phase serum specimens were drawn every 1&#x02013;2 weeks for 6 weeks. Serum specimens were stored at &#x02212;80&#x000b0;C and shipped to the University of Cincinnati and the Cincinnati VA Medial Center for analysis.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Recombinant antigens</title><p>The recombinant MsgC1 fragment was prepared by PCR using DNA isolated from <italic>P. jirovecii</italic> infected lung or cloned <italic>Msg</italic> genes as templates and Amplitaq enzyme (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) to generate <italic>msg</italic> gene segments <xref rid="pone.0014259-Garbe1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0014259-Daly1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0014259-Daly2" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. The PCR products were cloned into the pET30 vector (Novagen, Madison WI) and the recombinant MsgC1 proteins were expressed in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> and purified as previously described <xref rid="pone.0014259-Daly1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>IgG ELISA</title><p>The ELISA was performed as previously described <xref rid="pone.0014259-Daly2" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0014259-Daly3" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0014259-Walzer3" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0014259-Daly5" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>. Serum specimens to be analyzed and the standard reference serum were tested against recombinant MsgC1; PBS without antigen was used as a negative control. The reactivity of each serum specimen to Msg was corrected by subtraction of the reactivity of that serum to PBS (mean OD Msg &#x02013; mean OD PBS), and the results were quantified using the method of Bishop and Kovacs <xref rid="pone.0014259-Bishop1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>. A standard serum with specificity for MsgC1 was generated by mixing a pool of 4&#x02013;6 sera with high reactivity to MsgC1. A standard curve was generated for MsgC1 on each day of the assay and was used to calculate the units of reactivity to MsgC1. The standard serum pool was assigned a value of 100U of reactivity to MsgC1 construct in 100 &#x000b5;L of a 1: 100 dilution of serum. Sera were assayed at 1: 100 to 1: 200 dilutions to fit the linear portion of the standard curves and units of reactivity were calculated taking the dilution into account.</p></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>IgM ELISA</title><p>The IgM antibody reactivity to MsgC1 was measured using the same ELISA methods described above for IgG antibody reactivity except for the following changes. The secondary antibody was affinity-purified, HRP-labeled goat anti-human IgM (&#x003bc; chain) (KPL Products, Gaithersberg, MD) instead of goat anti-human IgG (H&#x00026;L) (KPL Products) was used for IgG antibodies. In a previous study, we tested the anti-IgM reagent for &#x003bc; chain specificity in two ways: 1) with serum from HIV&#x0002b; patients with heavy staining IgM antibody bands to <italic>P. jirovecii</italic> that had been separated by column chromatography into IgM and IgG fractions; and 2) with purified IgM and IgG on immunoblots <xref rid="pone.0014259-Peglow1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. In both cases, anti-IgM antibody only reacted with the IgM preparations, indicating that it was &#x003bc; chain-specific. As an additional measure of specificity, we have recently screened 200 healthy blood donors for IgM and IgG using the same IgG and IgM ELISA. Of 200 serum samples examined, IgG antibodies were detected in 103 (51.5&#x00025;) of the specimens, whereas IgM antibodies were only detected in 7 (3.5&#x00025;) of the specimens (p&#x0003c;0.001).</p></sec><sec id="s2f"><title>Statistical Analysis</title><p>Descriptive statistics were calculated to describe patient clinical and demographic characteristics. Categorical variables were analyzed by chi square statistics. Bivariate correlations measuring associations between MsgC1 antibodies and clinical variables at initial visit, and the auto-correlation between MsgC1 antibody responses on the same patient were calculated. The relationship of PcP infection to MsgC1 antibody levels was determined by the parameter estimate of dichotomized PcP infection in a linear mixed model, applied for modeling correlated log<sub>e</sub> MsgC1 antibody levels with left censoring. Mixed models are often used for estimating fixed effects and components of variability in longitudinal studies of continuous data. The model included a random intercept, which defined MsgC1 antibody values on the same patient to be correlated. Previous episode of PcP, CD4&#x0002b; count (&#x0003c;50, &#x02265;50 cells/&#x000b5;L), and one additional clinical variable, were modeled as fixed effects, in addition to PcP. Analyses were repeated when the additional clinical variable was replaced by a different clinical variable and all other variables remained the same. MsgC1 antibody responses during the first 6 weeks of follow-up were analyzed. For each interval, sensitivity and specificity were calculated for predicting PcP status, when MsgC1 antibody levels were dichotomized as above or below the cut points. We used parametric receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis methods to generate different cutpoints in each interval. The optimum cutpoint which was the same as the median value in each time interval was used to calculate the sensitivity and the specificity. SAS for Windows, version 9.2 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC) was used for all analyses and the statistical significance was based on the 5&#x00025; level. The graphs were produced using R software, version 2.9 (R project for statistical computing).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Results</title><sec id="s3a"><title>Demographic characteristics</title><p>At hospital admission, there were statistically significant differences in gender and racial distributions between PcP cases and controls <bold>(<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0014259.s001">Table S1</xref>)</bold>.

For example, the pilot study found no significant difference in antibody levels to MsgC1 between cases and controls at admission.

The present report found similar trends in these results, but they never reached statistical significance. Some reasons for these differences may involve a greater number of subjects in the present report; slight modifications in the ELISA in the last few years; and differences in statistical methods used to analyze the data. The analysis in the pilot study did not take into account values that were below the limit of detection; yet, in the present report we applied a regression model, which was able to handle censored values.</p><p>It is difficult to compare our study with previous reports because most of those studies used different antigen preparations, controls and methodology <xref rid="pone.0014259-Peglow1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0014259-Walzer2" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>.

The PcP patients also had a poor antibody response in convalescent specimens. Yet, studies of individual native <italic>Pneumocystis</italic> antigens suggested how these moieties might be useful in the future. In one report, technetium-labeled monoclonal antibodies to Msg showed promise (sensitivity of 85.7&#x00025;, specificity of 86.7&#x00025;) in using lung scans for the diagnosis of PcP <xref rid="pone.0014259-Goldenberg1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>. Unfortunately, the test was never commercially developed. Another report that used native Msg as the antigen found that HIV&#x0002b; patients with PcP had more frequent detectable antibodies and higher antibody levels than HIV&#x0002b; patients without PcP and healthy controls <xref rid="pone.0014259-Lundgren2" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. On the other hand, a study that used a different recombinant Msg fragment than the one used in our study found high antibody levels in non-HIV immunocompromised patients who experienced PcP; however, there were no differences in antibody levels in HIV&#x0002b; patients with PcP, HIV&#x0002b; patients without PcP, or healthy controls <xref rid="pone.0014259-Bishop1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>.</p><p>One way that serology can be used in the diagnosis of infectious diseases is to demonstrate that the antibody level in a single serum specimen is above the established normal range of values. The attractiveness of this approach is that it avoids the need to obtain a second (convalescent) specimen. The sensitivity, specificity and PPV of the serologic data at the time of hospitalization in our study were not as good as we had hoped. The reasons for these findings are unclear but may involve several factors: the severity of HIV and immunosuppression in the cases; <italic>P. jirovecii</italic> colonization in the controls, which can be quite common <xref rid="pone.0014259-Davis1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>; previous episodes of PcP; and antibody cross-reactivity with other microbial antigens, although little is known about this subject. The fact that the cases consistently had higher antibody levels than the controls and that the specificity and PPV of the serologic test increased over time is encouraging. The decrease in antibody levels contributed to these changes, but the reasons for this decrease are unknown. It is also possible that the serologic test will be more sensitive in analyzing differences when used in non-HIV patients with PcP, as shown in the higher antibody levels to recombinant Msg in these patients <xref rid="pone.0014259-Bishop1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>.</p><p>The other way to use serology as a diagnostic tool is to demonstrate a rise in antibody levels over time. When serial dilutions are used to measure antibody levels, a 4-fold or greater rise is considered to be significant. Yet, in our ELISA, the determination of what constitutes a significant rise is more complicated because serum specimens are diluted only once to a specific level (e.g., 1/100) and the antibody level is then derived from a standard curve. In addition to the present study, several other reports have shown that about 40&#x02013;50&#x00025; of HIV patients with PcP develop a rise in antibodies to Msg <xref rid="pone.0014259-Lundgren2" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0014259-Walzer3" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0014259-Daly5" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>. The increase in antibody levels in these patients helps support the diagnosis of PcP, but the failure to develop a rise (which occurred in the majority of cases) does not carry the same negative weight. The reasons for the relatively low frequency of antibody rises in PcP subjects are probably related to the advanced stage of HIV disease and its associated immunosuppression.</p><p>In light of the impaired B cell function in HIV infection and the low or absent IgM antibodies to <italic>P. jirovecii</italic> antigens in previous reports <xref rid="pone.0014259-Hofmann1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0014259-Lundgren1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0014259-Cagigi1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0014259-DeMilito1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>, the presence of elevated antibody levels in the present study is somewhat unusual and unexpected. However, we previously showed that HIV&#x0002b; patients with single or recurrent episodes of PcP can develop active IgM and/or IgG responses to crude <italic>P. carinii</italic> antigens, and that the secondary anti-IgM antibody, which was essentially the same product as used here, was &#x003bc;-specific <xref rid="pone.0014259-Peglow1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. In addition, IgM antibodies to specific antigens have been found in HIV&#x0002b; patients with CD4&#x0002b; &#x0003e;100 cells/&#x000b5;L who were immunized with <italic>Haemophilus influenza</italic>e Type b vaccine, and in the saliva of HIV&#x0002b; patients with <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> encephalitis <xref rid="pone.0014259-Kroon1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0014259-Singh1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>. The elevated IgM antibodies in the present study might be in response to new infection, especially if this is the first episode of PcP. If this is a recurrent episode, there might be a different strain of <italic>P. jirovecii</italic> that would elicit this response. One study showed that some patients who experienced 2 episodes of PcP greater than 6 months apart tended to be infected with different <italic>P. jirovecii</italic> isolates rather than the same isolate <xref rid="pone.0014259-Keely1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>. Also, the IgM antibodies may have been elicited by Msg that underwent antigenic variation in an already acquired strain of <italic>P. jirovecii</italic>.</p><p>The high antibody levels to MsgC1 raise questions about the host and environmental factors that contribute to them. In a recent long-term study of HIV&#x0002b; patients, we found that previous episode of PcP, geographic location, age and failure to take PcP prophylaxis were independently associated with increased IgG antibody levels to the recombinant MsgC1 fragments <xref rid="pone.0014259-Walzer3" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>. However, in the present study, we did not find significant effects of race, age, and gender on MsgC1 antibody levels. The discrepancy between this study and our previous report <xref rid="pone.0014259-Walzer3" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref> about the effect of age on MsgC1 antibody levels might be due to the differences in study design. In that study, MsgC1 antibody levels were measured on average 6 months after the diagnosis of PcP, but in this study, it was measured within weeks. As in our pilot study <xref rid="pone.0014259-Daly5" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>, the cases and controls in the present report differed significantly in terms of their CD4&#x0002b; counts, HIV viral loads, and LDH levels. Other investigators have also found higher LDH levels in PcP than in other forms of pneumonia <xref rid="pone.0014259-Krajicek1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0014259-Thomas1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0014259-Tasaka1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0014259-Selwyn1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. Thus, despite having more advanced HIV disease and more severe lung damage, cases were still able to develop higher antibody levels than the controls. Cases in the present report were also significantly more likely to be male and Caucasian than controls, whereas in the pilot study these differences did not reach statistical significance <xref rid="pone.0014259-Daly5" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>. The influence of race on PcP risk has shown conflicting results <xref rid="pone.0014259-Walzer3" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0014259-Stansell1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0014259-Kaplan1" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>. Yet, with recent studies showing that PcP acquisition is influenced by host single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in specific genes <xref rid="pone.0014259-Forthal1" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0014259-Duggal1" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref>, race might have a role in PcP incidence. Even though more studies are needed to elucidate this genetic association, the differences in PcP cases among racial groups found in this study might be due to genetic variation across different races.</p><p>This study has several limitations. It was only performed in HIV&#x0002b; patients, who are generally more immunosuppressed than most other populations at risk for PcP. Thus, the results obtained here may underestimate the diagnostic value of this serologic test. Similarly, the population here was entirely composed of adults. The value of the study in pediatric HIV&#x0002b; patients with PcP needs to be evaluated <xref rid="pone.0014259-Morrow1" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref>. Since the study was conducted at a single center, the results may not reasonably apply to hospitals in different geographic locations. Also, only a minority of control subjects had an alternative, non-PcP diagnosis confirmed microscopically. While it is possible that these individuals may have had PcP and a false-negative Diff-Quik test, we have previously shown a high sensitivity (&#x02265;98&#x00025;) and specificity (100&#x00025;) of this assay at SFGH <xref rid="pone.0014259-Huang1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>. Thus, we believe that we have classified our cases and controls accurately.</p><p>In conclusion, this is the first large scale use of a recombinant <italic>P. jirovecii</italic> antigen in the serologic diagnosis of PcP in HIV&#x0002b; patients. Overall, we are encouraged by the results and believe that they show promise as an aid to the diagnosis of PcP in situations where bronchoscopy cannot be performed. This promise may be increased by evaluating the test in different patient populations and in different geographic locations; delineating the areas of maximal reactions on Msg C1 and its closely related other Msg C fragments; and using Kexin 1 in combination with Msg C1. Serology may also be useful in conditions such as <italic>P. jirovecii</italic> colonization, as evidenced by decreased antibody levels to Kexin 1 <xref rid="pone.0014259-Morris2" ref-type="bibr">[46]</xref> and by our finding of low antibody levels to Msg C fragments in smokers (Walzer, PD unpublished observations). Finally, the presence of serology as a tool to examine the risk of nosocomial transmission of <italic>P. jirovecii</italic> infections may be enhanced by the findings of increased antibody levels in hospital personnel with patient contact <xref rid="pone.0014259-Tipirneni1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref> and the presence of <italic>P. jirovecii</italic> in the air surrounding patients with PcP <xref rid="pone.0014259-Choukri1" ref-type="bibr">[47]</xref>.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0014259.s001"><label>Table S1</label><caption><p>Demographic characteristics and baseline clinical measurements of patients with <italic>Pneumocystis jirovecii</italic> pneumonia (PcP cases) and patients with pneumonia due to other causes (controls).</p><p>(0.04 MB DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0014259.s001.doc"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0014259.s002"><label>Table S2</label><caption><p>The estimates and the associated p-value of the effects of different independent predictors on IgG and IgM antibody levels to MsgC1 in HIV-infected patients.</p><p>(0.04 MB DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0014259.s002.doc"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="COI-statement"><p><bold>Competing Interests: </bold>The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.</p></fn><fn fn-type="financial-disclosure"><p><bold>Funding: </bold>This work was supported by the Medical Research Service, Department of Veterans Affairs, RO1AI-06492 (to PDW), National Institutes of Health (NIH) K24 HL087713 and R01 HL090335 (LH).
