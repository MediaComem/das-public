While the primary molecular defects in type 2 diabetes remain largely unknown, genetic factors in combination with environmental factors are thought to be involved in the onset and development of the disease. Recent genome-wide association studies have identified <italic>CDKAL1</italic> (cyclin-dependent kinase 5 regulatory subunit associated protein 1-like 1) as a susceptibility gene for type 2 diabetes, which has been replicated in several populations <xref rid="pone.0015553-Zeggini1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0015553-Takeuchi1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. The <italic>CDKAL1</italic> gene is located on chromosome 6p22.3 and encodes a 65-kDa protein (CDKAL1). The expression of <italic>CDKAL1</italic> mRNA has been detected in human tissues including pancreatic islets, skeletal muscle and brain <xref rid="pone.0015553-Zeggini1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0015553-Scott1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. Although the function of CDKAL1 is still unclear, CDKAL1 is similar to cyclin-dependent kinase 5 regulatory subunit-associated protein 1 (CDK5RAP1), which is expressed in neuronal tissues, and inhibits cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (CDK5) activity by binding to the CDK5 activator p35 <xref rid="pone.0015553-Ching1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>.

The impaired glucose-induced first-phase insulin exocytosis was associated with a delayed and slow increase in [Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>]<sub>i</sub> during glucose stimulation in KO cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0015553-g005">Fig. 5</xref>). This may be due to the blunted responsiveness of K<sub>ATP</sub> channels to glucose stimulation in KO cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0015553-g006">Fig. 6</xref>). Indeed, ATP production in KO cells was low (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0015553-g007">Fig. 7</xref>) and may lead to blunted glucose-induced K<sub>ATP</sub> channel responsiveness followed by impaired Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> channel activity.</p><p>The target molecules for CDKAL1 are not yet known, although our data indicate that <italic>CDKAL1</italic> KO influences glucose-induced K<sub>ATP</sub> channel responsiveness through reduced ATP generation. Since CDKAL1 is similar to CDK5RAP1, we originally speculated that the function of CDKAL1 is mediated by CDK5, and is probably directly associated with increased Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> channel activity, as observed in p35 KO mice <xref rid="pone.0015553-Wei1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, or with insulin gene expression <xref rid="pone.0015553-Ubeda1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0015553-Ubeda2" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. However, there was no relationship between CDKAL1 and CDK5 in this study. Therefore, CDK5/p35-mediated regulation does not seem to be involved in CDKAL1 regulation of insulin release. Our data suggest that CDKAL1 is instead related to glucose metabolism, which is associated with ATP generation, K<sub>ATP</sub> channel activity and Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> channels activity.</p><p>The failure of glucose-induced ATP-generation may be due to defects at several stages of glucose metabolism including cytosolic glycolysis and mitochondrial metabolism. In <italic>CDKAL1</italic> KO cells, the glucose-stimulated mitochondrial membrane potential response was blunted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0015553-g007">Fig. 7B</xref>). In addition, KIC, which is a direct substrate for the TCA cycle, bypassing glycolysis, also reduced the mitochondrial membrane potential response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0015553-g007">Fig. 7C</xref>). Therefore, blunted mitochondrial membrane potential response is likely to be a key defect, resulting in a reduced ATP generation, K<sub>ATP</sub> channel responsiveness and Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> channel activity, and eventually leading to impaired insulin granule exocytosis in KO cells. Indeed, it has been reported that the selective impairment of glucose-induced insulin release in diabetic Goto-Kakizaki rats is associated with reduced sensitivity of K<sub>ATP</sub> channels to glucose by deficient oxidative metabolism of glucose in mitochondria <xref rid="pone.0015553-Giroix1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0015553-Portha1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>.</p><p>In KO cells, cytosolic free [Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>]<sub>i</sub> induced by glucose gradually reached the same level observed in WT cells.

The relationship between CDKAL1 deletion in the ER and reduced mitochondrial ATP generation remains unknown. However, it has been reported that the ER and mitochondria are in close contact, which supports communication between these two organelles <xref rid="pone.0015553-Walter1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. It is possible that ER dysfunction caused by <italic>CDKAL1</italic> KO may affect mitochondrial function in the KO cells.

The methylthio modification of adenosine in tRNA appears to be essential for efficient and highly accurate protein translation by the ER ribosome. However, it is still unclear how the role of CDKAL1 in tRNA may be linked to ER function or ATP generation in mitochondria. Thus, it is tempting to speculate that either ER dysfunction or ER stress may affect the mitochondrial membrane potential in KO cells.</p><p>It is particularly interesting to note that our TIRF imaging data showed that CDKAL1 deletion only impaired the first-phase, but not the second-phase, of glucose-induced insulin exocytosis. Our data are in good agreement with the results of Groenewoud et al. <xref rid="pone.0015553-Groenewoud1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref> and Stancakova et al. <xref rid="pone.0015553-Stancakova1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, who reported that <italic>CDKAL1</italic> variants decreased first-phase insulin secretion but not second-phase insulin in humans with type 2 diabetes. Thus, the altered expression of CDKAL1 is probably associated with reduced glucose-induced first-phase insulin exocytosis and thus confers an increased risk for diabetes.</p><p>Although our data showed a critical role of CDKAL1 in insulin exocytosis <italic>in vitro</italic>, the <italic>CDKAL1</italic> KO mice had almost normal glucose homeostasis (N.

The reason for the normal glucose homeostasis <italic>in vivo</italic>, despite reduced first-phase insulin release in vitro, is unknown, but there are several possibilities to be considered. First, the magnitude of the reduction in first-phase insulin release is not sufficient to cause impaired glucose tolerance in mice at this stage we examined. In fact, Stancakova et al. <xref rid="pone.0015553-Stancakova1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref> reported that the SNP rs7754840 of <italic>CDKAL1</italic> is associated with impaired insulin secretion in non-diabetic offspring of type 2 diabetic subjects and in a large sample of men with normal glucose tolerance. Second, the role of CDKAL1 on the regulation of insulin exocytosis may have a limited influence on whole-body glucose metabolism. Therefore, additional genetic and environmental factors may be needed to cause impaired glucose tolerance.</p><p>In summary, we have provided the first report documenting a role of CDKAL1 in &#x003b2; cells.
