In addition, we conducted a meta-analysis of 15 other prospective studies in eight countries conducted in essentially general populations. Compared with individuals in the bottom third of baseline measurements of serum uric acid in the Reykjavik study, those in the top third had an age- and sex-adjusted odds ratio for CHD of 1.39 (95&#x00025; confidence interval [CI], 1.23&#x02013;1.58) which fell to 1.12 (CI, 0.97&#x02013;1.30) after adjustment for smoking and other established risk factors. Overall, in a combined analysis of 9,458 cases and 155,084 controls in all 16 relevant prospective studies, the odds ratio was 1.13 (CI, 1.07&#x02013;1.20), but it was only 1.02 (CI, 0.91&#x02013;1.14) in the eight studies with more complete adjustment for possible confounders.</p></sec><sec id="st3"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Measurement of serum uric acid levels is unlikely to enhance usefully the prediction of CHD, and this factor is unlikely to be a major determinant of the disease in general populations.</p></sec></abstract><abstract abstract-type="toc"><p>The largest ever prospective analysis and meta-analysis of uric acid in coronary heart disease finds no evidence that uric acid is useful in predicting coronary heart disease</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Numerous genetic and environmental factors have been associated with uric acid [<xref rid="pmed-0020076-b01" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>], and serum uric acid values are markedly elevated in patients with gout (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pmed-0020076-t001">Table 1</xref>). Since at least fifty years ago, modestly higher serum uric acid concentrations have been reported in patients with coronary heart disease (CHD) than in controls [<xref rid="pmed-0020076-b02" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>], and there have been suggestions that measurement of serum uric acid can enhance the prediction of CHD [<xref rid="pmed-0020076-b03" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Prospective epidemiological studies have, however, reported apparently conflicting findings, with several studies reporting positive associations only among women [<xref rid="pmed-0020076-b04" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="pmed-0020076-b05" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], The interpretation of the data has been further complicated by the correlation of serum uric acid concentrations with several established coronary risk factors (such as blood pressure), with the use of cardiovascular medications (such as diuretics), and with clinical conditions associated with CHD (such as chronic renal disease [<xref rid="pmed-0020076-b06" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]). It has been difficult, therefore, to determine whether serum uric acid values are predictive of CHD, and, if so, whether any such associations are independent from established risk factors or from the effects of disease or both.</p><table-wrap id="pmed-0020076-t001" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><title>Characteristics of Uric Acid</title></caption><graphic xlink:href="pmed.0020076.t001"/><table-wrap-foot><fn id="nt101"><p>

To help put these results in context, we also report a meta-analysis of 15 previously published prospective studies of serum uric acid, involving a total of an additional 7,002 incident CHD cases and an additional 151,122 controls, including supplementary information obtained by correspondence from investigators to help assess in more detail the impact of possible confounders. The present analyses have been restricted to prospective cohorts sampled from essentially general populations (i.e., excluding cohorts selected on the basis of existing vascular or other diseases, or on the basis of having risk factors for vascular disease, such as high blood pressure) to reduce any distorting effects of preexisting disease on serum uric acid levels.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>The Reykjavik Study</title><p>The Reykjavik Study, initiated in 1967 as a prospective study of cardiovascular disease, has been described in detail previously [<xref rid="pmed-0020076-b07" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. All men born between 1907 and 1934 and all women born between 1908 and 1935 who were resident in Reykjavik, Iceland, and its adjacent communities on 01 December 1966 were identified in the national population register and then invited to participate in the Reykjavik Study during five stages of recruitment between 1967 and 1991, yielding 8,888 male and 9,681 female participants without a history of MI (72&#x00025; response rate). Nurses administered questionnaires, made physical measurements, recorded an electrocardiogram, performed spirometry, and collected fasting venous blood samples, which were stored at &#x02212;20 &#x000b0;C for subsequent analysis. All participants have been monitored subsequently for all-cause mortality and for cardiovascular morbidity, with a loss to follow-up of less than 1&#x00025; to date. A total of 2,459 men and women with available serum samples had major coronary events between the beginning of follow-up and 31 December 1995, yielding mean durations of follow-up among CHD cases of 17.5 (standard deviation [SD] 8.7) years and, among controls, of 20.6 (SD, 8.2) years. In total, 1,073 CHD deaths and 701 nonfatal MIs were recorded among men (including 564 confirmed MIs and 137 possible MIs), and 385 CHD deaths and 300 nonfatal MIs among women (including 237 confirmed MIs and 63 possible MIs). Deaths from coronary heart disease were ascertained from central registers on the basis of a death certificate with International Classification of Diseases codes 410&#x02013;414, and the diagnosis of nonfatal MI was based on MONICA criteria. We selected 3,969 controls that were &#x0201c;frequency-matched&#x0201d; to cases on calendar year of recruitment, sex, and age in 5-y bands from among participants who had survived to the end of the study period without a MI. The National Bioethics Committee and the Data Protection Authority of Iceland approved the study protocol, and participants provided informed consent.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Laboratory Methods</title><p>Serum uric acid levels were measured with a Technicon autoanalyzer [<xref rid="pmed-0020076-b08" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. The measurement of other biochemical analytes has been described previously [<xref rid="pmed-0020076-b07" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Baseline measurements of serum uric acid were available on 2,456 out of 2,459 CHD cases and 3,962 out of 3,969 controls. To assess the within-person consistency of serum uric acid levels over time, measurements were made in pairs of samples collected at an interval of about 12 y apart in 379 individuals in the present study.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Statistical Methods and Meta-Analysis</title><p>Case-control comparisons were made by unmatched stratified logistic regression fitted by unconditional maximum likelihood. Analysis of serum uric acid values was previously specified to be by sex-specific thirds of values in the controls (with subsidiary analyses involving other cut-off values). Adjustment was made for age, sex, smoking status (never, former, current), daily cigarette consumption, blood pressure, body mass index, fasting concentrations of total cholesterol and triglycerides, and various markers of socioeconomic status related to occupation, education, home ownership, and type of accommodation. We assessed variation in the strength of association according to pre-specified sub-groups, using likelihood ratio tests for interaction after adjusting for these factors, with 99&#x00025; confidence intervals (CIs) used in these exploratory analyses.</p><p>For the meta-analysis, studies of serum uric acid and CHD published before May 2003 with greater than a year's follow-up conducted in essentially general populations (i.e., excluding cohorts defined on the basis of preexisting cardiovascular or other diseases) were sought by computer-based searches, scanning the reference lists of all relevant studies and review articles, hand-searching of relevant journals, and correspondence with authors of studies. Computer searches using Medline, PubMed, Web of Science, and Embase databases used keywords relating to uric acid in combination with CHD (e.g., coronary heart disease, ischemic heart disease, vascular disease, MI, and atherosclerosis). Relevant endpoints included nonfatal MI (generally using World Health Organization criteria) and CHD death (generally using International Classification of Disease criteria).</p><p>The following factors were abstracted from each study: numbers of cases and controls, mean age of cases and percentage of males, mean duration of follow-up, assay type, and those used for adjustment in multivariable assessments. Five studies were excluded because they reported insufficient data or only unadjusted risk ratios [<xref rid="pmed-0020076-b09" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="pmed-0020076-b10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="pmed-0020076-b11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="pmed-0020076-b12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="pmed-0020076-b13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], but these involved only a total of about 590 CHD cases (or &#x0003c; 6&#x00025; of the total number of cases in the present report).

We excluded female-specific estimates based on fewer than 30 CHD cases, owing to very small sample sizes from two studies [<xref rid="pmed-0020076-b16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="pmed-0020076-b18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Where data were not available by thirds of serum uric acid levels, the log-relative risk (and its standard error) was estimated from the reported relative risks using log-linear scaling and assuming normality of the uric acid distribution, as described previously [<xref rid="pmed-0020076-b19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Where data were available only in separate age strata, a single pooled estimate was used. Fixed-effect summary measures were calculated as the inverse-variance weighted average of the log-relative risks. Heterogeneity was assessed by the heterogeneity Q statistic and by random effect regression models with restricted maximum likelihood estimation. Subsidiary analyses (conducted only on studies known to exclude individuals with existing CHD) grouped studies by sex, study size, geographical location, sampling framework (population- or workforce-based), degree of adjustment for other cardiovascular risk factors, type of assay, and duration of follow-up. Statistical analyses were conducted using Stata version 7.0. To make some allowance for multiple comparisons, 99&#x00025; CI were used for individual studies, and 95&#x00025; CI were reserved for the combined estimates.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Results</title><sec id="s3a"><title>The Reykjavik Study</title><p>The mean age at CHD event among cases was 70.2 (SD, 9.7) y.

The overall findings suggest that individuals with baseline serum uric acid values in the top third of the population have about a 10&#x00025; greater risk of CHD over the subsequent decade than those in the bottom third (with the likelihood that this association would be about twice as strong if based on long-term usual levels of serum uric acid). It is likely, however, that this modest association has been exaggerated by the preferential publication of striking findings in smaller studies (&#x0201c;publication bias&#x0201d;), or by residual confounding by established risk factors, or both. For example, the observation of weaker associations in studies with more comprehensive adjustment for possible confounders lessens the likelihood that any association between serum uric acid and CHD is independent from possible confounders; the odds ratio was only 1.02 (CI, 0.91&#x02013;1.14), which is not significant, in the eight studies with the most complete reported adjustment for possible confounders (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed-0020076-g003">Figure 3</xref>). The present data also provide no good evidence to support previous claims that the association between serum uric acid and CHD is stronger in females than in males [<xref rid="pmed-0020076-b05" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], or stronger at higher levels of established risk factors, such as in individuals with higher blood pressure recordings [<xref rid="pmed-0020076-b29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>].</p><p>The main implication of these data is to refute suggestions made throughout the past half-century that measurement of serum uric acid can importantly enhance the prediction of CHD in general populations. These data do not directly address the question of whether or not serum uric acid may be involved in the causation of CHD through a number of potentially relevant vascular effects (such as through the formation of free radicals or through the oxidation of low-density-lipoprotein cholesterol [<xref rid="pmed-0020076-b01" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="pmed-0020076-b30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]), but they suggest that serum uric acid levels are unlikely to be a major determinant of CHD.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="st001"><label>Table S1</label><caption><title>Comparison of Baseline Values of Risk Factors and Other Characteristics in Controls in the Reykjavik Study by Thirds of Serum Uric Acid Concentration</title><p>(67 KB DOC).</p></caption><media xlink:href="pmed.0020076.st001.doc"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><boxed-text id="box1" position="float"><sec id="sb1"><title>Patient Summary</title><sec id="sb1a"><title/><sec id="sb1a1"><title>Background</title><p>Defining which risk factors are important for disease is useful for clinicians and patients not only because the presence of risk factors allows the prediction of who is more likely to get a disease, but also because they provide some insight into the underlying causes of disease. One such suspected risk factor for coronary heart disease is the level of uric acid in the blood. The debate over whether uric acid is useful for predicting heart disease has been going on for over fifty years. Most evidence for risk factors comes from studies of populations, in which it can be hard to tease out the effects of many different factors; often studies come to different conclusions. One way of finding out which results are reliable is to pool the results of many studies.</p></sec><sec id="sb1a2"><title>What Did the Researchers Find?</title><p>They looked at the uric acid levels of around 2,500 people with coronary heart disease and almost 4,000 controls measured at the start of a large study in Iceland, and then investigated whether there was a relation between levels of uric acid and development of heart disease. After adjusting for all the other factors that could affect the chance of heart disease, they found that uric acid did not predict heart disease. They then combined these results with those from 15 other studies, and confirmed the findings.</p></sec><sec id="sb1a3"><title>What Do These Findings Mean?</title><p>After fifty years, it now seems clear that measurement of uric acid does not help to predict heart disease.
