Traditionally, endotracheal intubation is the first choice for airway management in FESS because it provides a definite sealing effect on airway protection. The use of a laryngeal mask airway (LMA) is associated with considerable advantages in ear, nose and throat (ENT) procedures, including more stable haemodynamics, a better surgical field, smoother emergence and fewer airway complications than are observed with endotracheal tubes (ETTs) [<xref rid="pone.0245521.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. It has been recently postulated that LMA provides a better surgical field by decreasing catecholamine release in FESS compared to ETT [<xref rid="pone.0245521.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. The flexible laryngeal mask airway (FLMA) is suitable for FESS, as proper placement of the FLMA provides an adequate seal for the oropharyngeal cavity against airway contamination. Compared with other types of LMA and supraglottic airway devices (SGAs), the long flexible and wire-reinforced tube is easily placed under thick layers, stays out of the surgical field, and is resistant to surgical compression, and it does not interfere with surgical manipulation. Additionally, greater movement of the tube during surgery has little effect on the lodgement of the cuff or its ability to seal the airway [<xref rid="pone.0245521.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>].</p><p>However, there is great concern about whether FLMA safely protects the airway during FESS. Manipulation of the well vascularized capillary beds located in the sinonasal mucosa leads to continuous bleeding, and this blood can flow into the glottis and contaminate the tracheobronchial tree during the general anaesthesia and recovery period. Accordingly, many anaesthesiologists and otolaryngologists are reluctant to use FLMA in FESS. However, several prospective trials have indicated that FLMA effectively protects the airway from blood contamination during FESS, showing superiority in protecting the glottis and subglottic airway [<xref rid="pone.0245521.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0245521.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Other concerns are related to the failure rate of FLMA ventilation, which can occur because, compared with other types of LMA, the elasticity of its tube makes it more difficult to insert and align accurately. FLMA failure is associated with the oropharyngeal structure of the patient, head and neck rotation, insufficient ventilation, gastric insufflation during positive pressure ventilation (PPV), and insufficient anaesthetic depth. Nekhendzy et al reported that the success rate of FLMA was 92.6% in 685 patients who underwent elective ENT surgery; in these patients, half of the failures occurred during induction and half during operation [<xref rid="pone.0245521.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. When FLMA failure occurs during FESS, it is difficult to readjust the position of the FLMA or change to an ETT, and both require interrupting the operation and putting the airway at risk. However, no large sample studies have provided definitive data about FLMA failure and airway complications that occur during FESS.</p><p>We conducted this retrospective study at our ternary hospital to evaluate the success rate of FLMA in FESS and to describe the specific clinical factors associated with FLMA failure and airway complications related to FLMA usage.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec006"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="sec007"><title>Ethics approval</title><p>The Ethics Committee of Beijing Tongren Hospital, Capital Medical University provided ethical approval for this study on June 20, 2016 (Chairman, Prof. Ningli Wang; protocol number, TRECKY2016-020). The requirement for written informed consent was waived since this is a retrospective study.</p></sec><sec id="sec008"><title>Study design and subjects</title><p>We retrospectively reviewed the perioperative clinical information of all adult patients who underwent FESS in our hospital from April 1, 2015, to December 31, 2019. Only patients diagnosed with chronic rhinosinusitis were included. Patients who received FESS for paranasal sinus neoplasms, skull base tumours, and other non-rhinosinusitis were excluded. Other exclusion criteria were emergency surgery, children or adolescents (age under 18), and patients undergoing other neurosurgical, laryngeal and stomatological procedures requiring tracheal intubation. The study period was chosen based on the availability of information from the electronic anaesthesia information system (AIMS, Beijing Easymonitor Tech, Beijing, China) during this period. All preoperative, intraoperative and postoperative data were documented by anaesthesia residents, attending physicians and certified anaesthesia nurses. The patient&#x02019;s medical history (e.g., allergic rhinitis, asthma, and chronic bronchitis), preoperative interview and anaesthesia plan (e.g., airway evaluation, choice of airway device), intraoperative record (e.g., airway device and size, details of airway device changes, ventilation parameters, adverse airway events, time of oral or endotracheal suction and vital signs), and postoperative follow-up in the post-anaesthesia care room (PACU) or in the ward were all collected. We carried out this study and accessed the databases to obtain the data used in this study from July 1, 2016, to January 3, 2020.</p><p>The objective of this study was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of FLMA in FESS. The primary outcomes were the success rate of FLMA ventilation, including primary success after induction and final success supporting the whole surgery. The secondary outcomes were (1) specific factors associated with FLMA failure, including patient characteristics, surgical time and FLMA size, (2) adverse airway events, including gastric regurgitation and aspiration, desaturation, bronchospasm, laryngospasm, and airway injuries related to use of FLMA.</p><p>Our study was retrospective in nature. To avoid selection bias, we recruited all consecutive patients undergoing elective FESS for chronic rhinosinusitis. In our clinical practice, general anaesthesia for FESS is standardized without being overly particular. Successful ventilation of FLMA in FESS was defined as no audible air leakage from the mouth during manual ventilation at a tidal volume &#x02265; 6 mL/kg, bilaterally identical pulmonary auscultation without auscultation of gastric air insufflation in the epigastric area before the oropharyngeal leak pressure (OLP) arrived, and OLP was at least 5 cm H<sub>2</sub>O greater than peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) during PPV. Gastric regurgitation, aspiration, desaturation, upper airway obstruction with/without FLMA displacement, laryngospasm and bronchospasm were defined as immediate airway events since we could diagnose them immediately. Sore throat and hoarseness were evaluated in the PACU. Any patient with a severe sore throat, dysphagia or hoarseness persisting for more than 12 h received fibre-optic laryngoscopy by an otorhinolaryngologist, and any trauma or nerve injury associated with use of FLMA was defined as delayed airway injury.</p><p>Clinical information on age, sex, body mass index (BMI), American Society of Anaesthesiologists (ASA) classification, comorbidities, duration of surgery, airway management and airway complications were obtained from the AIMS. Hypercapnia was not always recorded in our study because end-tidal carbon dioxide partial pressure (ETCO<sub>2</sub>) was sometimes monitored by portable monitors, and the data were not recorded automatically in the system. Details of FLMA success that occurred during anaesthesia induction or during surgical manipulation were manually reviewed and defined as primary success and secondary success, respectively.</p></sec><sec id="sec009"><title>Anaesthesia management</title><p>No premedication was administered. General anaesthesia was induced with intravenous (I.V.) propofol (1.5&#x02013;2 mg kg<sup>-1</sup>) or etomidate (0.2 mg kg<sup>-1</sup>), sufentanil (0.3 &#x003bc;g kg<sup>-1</sup>) and cisatracurium (0.2 mg kg<sup>-1</sup>), or rocuronium (0.6 mg kg<sup>-1</sup>) and maintained with total intravenous anaesthesia of propofol and remifentanil or inhaled anaesthesia of sevoflurane. FLMA (Medis, Medical Ltd, Tianjin, China) insertion was performed by an anaesthesia resident under the supervision of an anaesthesia attending physician or by the attending physician himself/herself. Each attending physician has performed 500 FLMA procedures annually for at least 3 years. The size of the FLMA was mainly dependent on the patient&#x02019;s weight and based on the manufacturer&#x02019;s recommendation (size 3 for 35&#x02013;50 kg, size 4 for 50&#x02013;70 kg, size 5 for 70&#x02013;100 kg and size 6 for over 100 kg). The FLMA insertion technique is presented in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0245521.s001">S1 Fig</xref>. After insertion, the cuff was inflated to 60 cm H<sub>2</sub>O. The OLP was checked by setting the pressure-limiting valve of the circular system to 35 cm H<sub>2</sub>O and then manually inflating the bag with a fresh gas flow at 5 L min<sup>-1</sup>. The airway pressure was monitored on the anaesthesia machine until the airway pressure reached a steady state and there was air leakage around the patient&#x02019;s mouth. Meanwhile, auscultation over the epigastrium was performed to avoid gastric air insufflation before OLP was achieved. Then, volume-controlled ventilation (tidal volume, 6&#x02013;8 mL/kg of ideal body weight) was initiated, and the respiratory rate was controlled to maintain EtCO<sub>2</sub> at 35&#x02013;40 mmHg. To ensure the safety of FLMA, the anaesthesia resident was only allowed two attempts at insertion, and then the attending physician was allowed to the third attempt. If FLMA ventilation failed after three insertion attempts during the induction period, the patient was immediately intubated with an ETT. During surgical manipulation, if the PIP abruptly increased or audible air leakage from the mouth occurred, surgical manipulation was suspended, machine-controlled ventilation was changed to manual ventilation, and a muscle relaxant was administered if necessary. If air leakage persisted, oropharyngeal secretions were removed by a suction apparatus, and the patient was intubated with an ETT. Endotracheal suction was subsequently carried out. Details of the change from FLMA to ETT were recorded. FLMA or ETT was removed after the patient regained consciousness or could maintain adequate ventilation (tidal volume of 6&#x02013;8 ml/kg, respiratory rate &#x02265;10/min and EtCO<sub>2</sub> &#x0003c; 50 mmHg). All patients stayed in the PACU for further recovery for more than 20 min.</p></sec><sec id="sec010"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Statistical analyses were carried out with IBM SPSS 24 software (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). Qualitative data are presented as numbers and percentages. Demographic data were evaluated for normality with the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. Patients with and without FLMA failure were compared according to demographic and clinical characteristics by Pearson&#x02019;s chi-square test or Fisher&#x02019;s exact test for categorical variables, while continuous variables were compared using <italic>t</italic> tests (normally distributed) or Mann-Whitney <italic>U</italic> tests (non-normally distributed). Univariate logistic regressions were performed to identify potentially significant factors. Variables considered to be significant with a <italic>P</italic>-value less than 0.05 in the univariate analysis were entered into the multiple logistic regression analysis.</p><p>For the purposes of multivariate analysis, patients were classified according to BMI into underweight (&#x0003c;18.5 kg/m<sup>2</sup>), normal (18.5&#x02013;22.9 kg/m<sup>2</sup>), overweight (23&#x02013;27.4 kg/m<sup>2</sup>) and obese (&#x02265;27.5 kg/m<sup>2</sup>) groups according to the WHO recommendations for Chinese people [<xref rid="pone.0245521.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]; according to age using a continuous concept in which the ranges divided groups into 10-year epochs; and according to ASA dichotomously into low-grade ASA (ASA I) and high-grade ASA (ASA II and ASA III). Because BMI can be considered representative of weight, we excluded weight in the regression model. The adjusted odds ratio (OR) with the 95% confidence interval (95% CI) was used to describe the effect of each independent variable on the risk of FLMA failure.</p><p>Sample size estimation was performed to define the power of the data analysis as previously described [<xref rid="pone.0245521.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0245521.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Based on an expected FLMA failure rate of 2.3%, a sample size of 4347 would allow the evaluation of at least 10 covariates (five were included in our study).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec011"><title>Results</title><p>A total of 6790 consecutive adult patients who underwent FESS for chronic rhinosinusitis were identified from 2015 to 2019.

Four independent factors were found to predict FLMA failure: male sex, advanced age, higher ASA grade and increased BMI. Immediate adverse respiratory events were observed in 0.85% of cases, and the incidence of delayed airway injuries associated with use of FLMA was 0.07%.</p><sec id="sec013"><title>Safety and efficacy of FLMA</title><p>One of the great concerns regarding the application of FLMA in FESS is whether it can protect the airway from surgical bleeding and flushing fluid during general anaesthesia with PPV. OLP is a critical parameter to evaluate the sealing function of LMA. A higher OLP means better sealing and little possibility of air leakage. Many factors contribute to OLP, including the LMA position, type and size of the LMA, cuff pressure, position of the head and neck, surgical manipulations and usage of muscle relaxants [<xref rid="pone.0245521.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0245521.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Although an OLP test is recommended before surgery, there is so far no consensus regarding the specific OLP value that is safe for the airway. Another problem is the question of how inadvertent gastric insufflation can be avoided because the high airway pressure delivered by the LMA might be transmitted to the oesophagus and stomach and could increase the possibility of regurgitation and aspiration. Usually, gastric insufflation is detected by a stethoscope placed at the epigastric area [<xref rid="pone.0245521.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Gastric insufflation occurs more when the PIP is increased during PPV [<xref rid="pone.0245521.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Therefore, a lower PIP is helpful to reduce the incidence of gastric insufflation. In our clinical practice, we ensured that all FESS cases with FLMA usage were compliant in maintaining a difference between OLP and PIP of more than 5 cm H<sub>2</sub>O, and no air leakage was detected around the epigastric area before OLP was achieved. PIP was carefully monitored during surgical manipulation, and any abruptly increased PIP or air leakage was handled immediately. Among the 6661 patients in our study, no severe respiratory event was associated with FLMA failure or an inability to protect the airway. This result supports our strategy of controlling the gap between OLP and PIP, which plays an important role in ensuring the safety of FLMA during PPV. Further studies aimed at exploring the advantages of our strategy could focus on respiratory dynamics, air leakage and gastric insufflation pressure. However, gastric insufflation is not continuously monitored during the operation in our clinical practice. Thus, asymptomatic gastric insufflation might be underestimated in our study. Nonetheless, we consider that FLMA with a gastric drainage aperture is a better choice for FESS.</p><p>Since the FLMA is more flexible, its insertion may be more difficult than that of a classic LMA [<xref rid="pone.0245521.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. The total incidence of FLMA failure of 2.2% in our study is slightly higher than the failure rates of 0.86&#x02013;1.1% for LMA reported in other large observational non-ENT studies [<xref rid="pone.0245521.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0245521.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] and significantly lower than the 7.4% failure rate previously reported for FLMA in ENT surgery [<xref rid="pone.0245521.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Our relatively low failure rate might be attributed to our clinical practice of having an attending supervise. We did not count the number of attempts at FLMA insertion because the number depends on the experience of the anaesthetist. Our success rate is attributed to the level of experience of the attending physician, which precludes experience as a confounder in this study.</p><p>The physiological characteristics of the patient, such as male sex, advanced age, and high BMI, were associated with FLMA failure in our study, consistent with previous reports on non-ENT surgery [<xref rid="pone.0245521.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0245521.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Patients with a high BMI are likely to have larger pharyngeal fat pad areas [<xref rid="pone.0245521.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], which leads to a decrease in the pharyngeal area. A narrow pharyngeal cavity increases the number of FLMA attempts, the failure rate and the incidence of airway injury. Ageing increases pharyngeal muscular atrophy and pharyngeal volume and flattens the upper airway [<xref rid="pone.0245521.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]; these anatomical changes in the pharyngeal cavity might influence the success of FLMA. ASA grade was also identified as an independent predictor of FLMA failure, a result that was likely attributable to the associations between higher ASA grade and both advanced age and overweight/obesity in our study. It is interesting that male sex was the risk factor most significantly associated with FLMA failure. This result could be explained by the fact that certain craniofacial features specific to males affect the oropharyngeal cavity and make them prone to upper airway obstruction during sleep and general anaesthesia [<xref rid="pone.0245521.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>].</p><p>With regard to secondary failure that occurred during the surgical procedure, we consider that both surgical manipulation of the head and neck and insufficient muscle relaxation could lead to an abrupt increase in PIP, FLMA displacement and FLMA ventilation failure. Before the surgical procedure, surgical preparations include covering over the patient&#x02019;s head with a sterile treatment sheet, which requires flexing the patient&#x02019;s head for a while; at the beginning of the surgery, the surgeon usually rotates the patient&#x02019;s head 10 to 15 degrees towards him to facilitate surgical manipulation. Previous studies report that the flexed neck position may elicit airway obstruction and impair ventilation, whereas rotation of the head and neck has little effect on supraglottic airway device ventilation [<xref rid="pone.0245521.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0245521.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. In our study, fourteen cases (0.2%) failed after changing the head and neck position; however, forty-six cases (0.7%) failed intraoperatively, when the position of the patient&#x02019;s head was rarely changed. Therefore, we suggest that changing the head and neck position is not the only reason for secondary failure. Consistent with other reports, we found that almost half of the FLMA procedures performed without an optimal fibreoptic bronchoscopy (FOB) position provided satisfactory OLP and ventilation [<xref rid="pone.0245521.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0245521.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. We therefore consider that if the FLMA is sub-optimally placed in the oesophageal inlet, displacement is apt to occur when the patient&#x02019;s swallowing reflex recovers or their head and neck position changes, resulting in FLMA dislodgement and ventilation failure. Further studies should focus on whether sub-optimal positioning of the FLMA is related to secondary failure during surgery.</p></sec><sec id="sec014"><title>Airway complications of FLMA during FESS</title><p>The incidence of adverse respiratory events was 0.85% in our study, consistent with a previous report on non-ENT surgery [<xref rid="pone.0245521.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Nineteen (0.28%) patients experienced desaturation during induction and the operation, which could be explained by FLMA failure and a change in airway device; however, other complications, such as bronchospasm during mask ventilation, laryngospasm and bronchospasm after FLMA removal, might not be directly related to the use of FLMA.</p><p>Compared with other surgical procedures, otolaryngical procedures are associated with a high incidence of perioperative respiratory adverse events in both children and adults [<xref rid="pone.0245521.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0245521.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. For example, intraoperative bronchospasm occurs more frequently during sinus surgery than during nonsinus surgery, with an incidence of 0.7 to 2.6% [<xref rid="pone.0245521.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. The possible explanations include direct surgical stimulation of the airway and a higher incidence of airway hypersensitivity. It has been recognized that in sinonasal diseases, upper airway remodelling overlaps with lower airway remodelling [<xref rid="pone.0245521.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0245521.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]; therefore, patients with chronic rhinosinusitis have a high incidence of coexisting allergic rhinitis and asthma and are thus at risk of perioperative bronchospasm and laryngospasm. For these patients with allergic rhinitis and asthma, a thorough preoperative assessment including patient history, physical examinations and lab studies should be performed to ensure that the airway disease is well controlled. Since tracheal intubation is a well-known trigger of bronchospasm [<xref rid="pone.0245521.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], FLMA is our first choice to control the airway for chronic rhinosinusitis unless there are other contraindications. The FLMA should be removed when these patients are fully conscious to ensure adequate gastroesophageal reflux and avoid aspiration. Despite these precautions, five (0.08%) cases of life-threatening severe bronchospasm attacks occurred during induction and recovery. We suggest that more effort is needed to identify the potential risks of bronchospasm in patients who undergo otolaryngical procedures, and guidelines for early identification and prompt management would be valuable to prevent further deterioration.</p><p>In our study, postoperative laryngospasm was the most common airway complication. Systematic reviews have shown that there is no clear difference in the incidence of postoperative laryngospasm between LMA and tracheal tubes in adults [<xref rid="pone.0245521.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0245521.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. The direct reasons for postoperative laryngospasm were not well documented in our study. Based on our experience, insufficient suction of blood and inappropriate timing of FLMA removal can lead to laryngospasm and result in severe complications. In this study, laryngospasm occurred in two healthy muscular male patients when they unconsciously bit the FLMA during recovery. Refractory desaturation and NPPE occurred. The incidence of NPPE is approximately 0.1% in adults undergoing general anaesthesia [<xref rid="pone.0245521.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Although NPPE is more closely associated with tracheal extubation, an increase in LMA-related NPPE has been recently reported due to the higher proportion of procedures involving LMA applications [<xref rid="pone.0245521.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0245521.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. In our study, the development of NPPE might be explained by forceful inspiration and acute airway obstruction due to laryngospasm. We encourage our colleagues to be vigilant in monitoring for refractory desaturation during recovery and aware of the occurrence of and treatment for NPPE while using LMA. Additionally, we suggest that the FLMA should be removed when the patient is fully conscious after FESS.</p><p>Considering other complications, the 9.55% incidence of sore throat observed in our study is within the range of previous reports (5.8 to 34%) [<xref rid="pone.0245521.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. It should be noted that the incidence of severe nerve and tissue damage related to FLMA usage, including arytenoid dislocation, pharyngopalatine arch damage and hoarseness caused by recurrent laryngeal nerve injury, was 0.07% in our study. The patients&#x02019; medical records showed that all these injuries were associated with repeated FLMA insertion. All of the affected patients underwent unplanned therapy, and no sequelae occurred. We suggest that more attention should be paid to improving the success of first insertion and avoiding excessive attempts.</p></sec><sec id="sec015"><title>Limitations</title><p>Our study has some limitations that should be noted. First, this is a retrospective study, which includes the lack of randomization and exclusion of some confounding factors. However, FLMA management is standardized in our hospital, and we recruited all consecutive patients undergoing FESS for chronic rhinosinusitis within a certain period. The results of this study exclude subjective factors as much as possible. Second, we did not count the number of attempts for each case because of incomplete data, and we do not routinely use FOB to assess the FLMA position or carry out neuromuscular monitoring for each case; therefore, we cannot provide more information about the cases of failed FLMA. Third, gastric insufflation was excluded after FLMA insertion, but it was not continuously monitored during the operation; thus, asymptomatic gastric insufflation might be underestimated in our study. Fourth, patients with chronic rhinosinusitis are likely to suffer from obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA), possibly due to increased upper airway inflammation and increased upper airway resistance [<xref rid="pone.0245521.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0245521.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Although many patients reported symptoms of OSA in their medical records, not all of these cases were confirmed by overnight polysomnography. Thus, OSA was not included as an independent variable in our univariate analysis. Finally, our study was carried out in a single tertiary health centre, but otorhinolaryngology is a key discipline in our hospital. Both the surgeon and the anaesthesiologist are familiar with FLMA and each other&#x02019;s surgical approaches. Differences in anaesthetic and surgical techniques should be considered when interpreting our results.</p><p>Despite these limitations, the results of our study shed light on a common but little-studied issue encountered by both anaesthesiologists and rhinologists. By demonstrating the FLMA failure rate, high-risk factors for FLMA failure, and the incidence of airway complications in a large patient sample, this study provides detailed evidence that can be used by clinicians when deciding whether to use FLMA in FESS.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec016"><title>Conclusions</title><p>In this study, we report a FLMA success rate of 97.7% in 6661 adult patients undergoing elective FESS for chronic rhinosinusitis. Intraoperative FLMA failure was uncommon (0.7%). Male sex, advanced age, higher ASA grade and higher BMI were independent risk factors for failed FLMA ventilation. FLMA-related adverse respiratory events and airway injures are rare, but clinicians should remain vigilant so that early diagnosis and prompt treatment can be provided.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec017"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0245521.s001"><label>S1 Fig</label><caption><title>The technique of FLMA insertion.</title><p>(A) Opening the oral cavity; (B) Placing the laryngeal mask into the oral cavity; (C) Lacing the laryngeal mask into the pharyngeal cavity; (D) FOB view.</p><p>(TIF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0245521.s001.tif"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>Assistance with the article: We gratefully acknowledge Shaofei Su, PhD (Department of Epidemiology and Health Statistics, Beijing Obstetrics and Gynaecology Hospital, Capital Medical University) for statistical consultation and the editors at American Journal Experts for their assistance in improving the English language herein.</p></ack><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0245521.ref001"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><name><surname>Brunner</surname><given-names>JP</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Levy</surname><given-names>JM</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Ada</surname><given-names>ML</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Tipirneni</surname><given-names>KE</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Barham</surname><given-names>HP</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Oakley</surname><given-names>GM</given-names></name>, <etal>et al</etal>

</p><p>PONE-D-20-20651</p><p>Safety, efficacy and airway complications of the flexible laryngeal mask airway in functional endoscopic sinus surgery: a retrospective study of 6661 patients</p><p>PLOS ONE</p><p>Dear Dr. Wang,</p><p>Thank you for submitting your manuscript to PLOS ONE. After careful consideration, we feel that it has merit but does not fully meet PLOS ONE&#x02019;s publication criteria as it currently stands. Therefore, we invite you to submit a revised version of the manuscript that addresses the points raised during the review process.</p><p>==============================</p><p>ACADEMIC EDITOR</p><p>Thank you for your submission that retrospectively analyses the use of flexible laryngeal mask airways in a large cohort of patients undergoing FESS. To my knowledge this is the largest study of its kind and in this lies the real strength of the data obtained. The major concern of this paper are the biases and limitations associated with it being retrospective in nature. Although this is acknowledged in the limitation section of the paper I would also recommend elaborating on the specific bias ( e.g recall, and selection bias etc) that is found in retrospective observational reports. Unless this study recruited all consecutive patients undergoing FESS, is it not possible that FESS patients deemed to be at high risk of failing LMA were excluded from the study which would therefore influence the true failure rate. Please address the above and the questions and suggestions raised by both reviewers</p><p>Please submit your revised manuscript by Nov 05 2020 11:59PM.

The study aims to evaluate the safety and efficiency of FLMA in FESS. Furthermore, risk factors for FLMA failure and airway complications are evaluated. The authors conclude that the FLMA can be safely and effectively used in patients undergoing FESS. The manuscript is written very well, includes a high number of patients and addresses an interesting question.</p><p>Other studies have shown outcome of the FMLA use in ENT surgery, so the impact of the study regarding the raised question might be limited. However, these are still significant findings as it is the first report of this kind specifically for this subgroup of ENT patients. Particularly endoscopic sinus surgery can lead to significant bleeding the question of whether this kind of airway management in these patients is safe is of interest. Therefore, it is a valuable scientific contribution and should be published. However, there are some severe and minor concerns which require a major revision as follows.</p><p>- was the insertion and application of the FMLA also performed by anesthetists in training? Or might the high success rate compared to other studies (7,2% in NeKHeNDZY et. al) be attributed to the high level of experience of senior anesthetists. This might be a confounder of the study.</p><p>- Regarding risk factors it is surprising that the BMI is associated with adverse outcome.The authors should discuss the fact that others did not find an association between primary success/failure and patients&#x02019; age and BMI.</p><p>- Were the number of insertion attempts documented and evaluated as a predictor for failed FLMA application? If not the authors should include this in the analysis.</p><p>- How was patient selection performed? Were all patients, even those with highest ASA scores and comorbidities part of the analysis or primarily attributed for EET?</p><p>- One of the major concerns of the use of FMAL is gastric insufflation. Malpositioning might occur despite seemingly uneventful FMLA placement. What was the percentage rate of gastric insufflation in the study cohort?</p><p>- From the FESS surgeons perspective the rotation of the patient&#x02019;s head is crucial to achieve good surgical outcomes. Was rotation of the patient&#x02019;s head the most the direct reason for secondary failure?</p><p>- The authors should elaborate and extend the section on advantages of FMLA to underline the key adavantages of the FMLA over EET. Furthermore, a clarification of the main differences between the FMLA and the conventional laryngeal mask should be included as the non-anesthetist readership might not be completely aware why the conventional mask is not applicable in FESS.</p><p>Reviewer #2:&#x000a0;the manuscript claims to report safety, efficacy and airway complications of the flexible laryngeal mask airway in functional endoscopic sinus surgery as retrospective study.

<named-content content-type="author-response-date">6 Nov 2020</named-content>
</p><p>Response to Reviewers</p><p>Dear Editor, </p><p>I greatly appreciate you and the reviewers for all the comments, critiques and efforts to help optimize our manuscript. We have made all of the changes you recommended and ensured that all of the documents now correspond to the correct format. As previously communicated, we are grateful that the reviewers raised interesting issues, which we believe will help better communicate our message, and we are happy to respond to their comments. </p><p>Our point-by-point responses are listed below.</p><p>Handling Editor&#x02019;s Comments:</p><p>1. The major concern of this paper are the biases and limitations associated with it being retrospective in nature. Although this is acknowledged in the limitation section of the paper I would also recommend elaborating on the specific bias ( e.g recall, and selection bias etc) that is found in retrospective observational reports. Unless this study recruited all consecutive patients undergoing FESS, is it not possible that FESS patients deemed to be at high risk of failing LMA were excluded from the study which would therefore influence the true failure rate. Please address the above and the questions and suggestions raised by both reviewers</p><p>Yes, this study recruited all consecutive patients undergoing FESS for chronic rhinosinusitis from April 1, 2015 to December 31, 2019. We mentioned this point in abstract (line 25), method (line 91), and result (line 184). From line 113 to line 131 in method section, we described the data collection and definition of our outcome in detail to avoid selection bias.</p><p>Reviewers' Comments:</p><p>Reviewer #1: </p><p>&#x000a0;1.was the insertion and application of the FMLA also performed by anesthetists in training? Or might the high success rate compared to other studies (7,2% in NeKHeNDZY et. al) be attributed to the high level of experience of senior anesthetists. This might be a confounder of the study.</p><p>We didn&#x02019;t count the attempt times of FLMA insertion, and we only mention successful ventilation in our study. Attempt times might reflect the experience of the anesthetists. In our clinical practice, general anaesthesia for FESS is standardized without being very particular. In our study, FLMA (Medis, Medical Ltd, Tianjin, China) insertion was performed by an anesthesia resident under supervision of an anesthesia attending physician, or by an attending himself/herself. Each attending physician has performed FLMA 500 cases annually at least for 3 years (line 137 to 140). To ensure the safety of FLMA usage, the anaesthesia resident was only allowed two attempts at insertion, and then the attending physician was allowed to try for a third time (line 149 to 151). If the third time is not successful, we change to endotracheal intubation(ETT). Our final success rate is attributed to the attending physician. We consider that the difference between our results and others (7.2% in NeKHeNDZY et. al) is our clinical practice (attending physician supervision, strict control of the difference between OLP and PIP), and we only recruited FESS without facial plastic surgery (in NeKHeNDZY et. al)). In our experience, patients who needs facial plastic surgery usually combined with maxillofacial dysplasia, a potential risk of difficult airway and LMA failure, or need more surgical manipulation of head and neck. ( NeKHeNDZY et. Al didn&#x02019;t describe this detail).</p><p>2. - Regarding risk factors it is surprising that the BMI is associated with adverse outcome. The authors should discuss the fact that others did not find an association between primary success/failure and patients&#x02019; age and BMI.</p><p>Yes, it is interesting that few article has discussed the relation between FLMA failure and BMI/age. In our hospital, our otolaryngologis use upper airway computed tomography to evaluate the effect of aging and high BMI on upper airway morphology changes[1]. We&#x02019;ve discussed the result of our study together, and they&#x02019;ve pointed out the effect of upper airway morphology change and FLMA lodgement. We&#x02019;ve added this discussion from line 272 to 276. </p><p>&#x000a0;3. Were the number of insertion attempts documented and evaluated as a predictor for failed FLMA application? If not the authors should include this in the analysis.</p><p>We didn&#x02019;t count the attempt times of FLMA insertion, because attempt times depends on the experience of the anaesthetists. Our final success rate is attributed to the level of experience of the attending physician, which excludes the experience as a confounder in this study. We discuss this point from line 266 to line 269.</p><p>4. - How was patient selection performed? Were all patients, even those with highest ASA scores and comorbidities part of the analysis or primarily attributed for EET?</p><p>The description of method was not very clear in our primary manuscript, and we have revised then.</p><p>Patients&#x02019; recruitment is described in method section from line 91 to line 96 and result section from line 184 to line 189. Patients with severe impairment in lung function requiring possible postoperative ventilation support was primarily attributed for EET, and this was documented in the preoperative evaluation and we can manually review it and exclude it. FESS for chronic rhinosinusitis is an elective surgery. Patient with highest ASA scores and comorbidities, or with a poor general condition is not appropriate for this surgery. Patients with ASA III, who have stable coronary disease or chronic heart function insufficiency are always scheduled for FLMA, unless they have severe respiratory impairment. Urgent surgery, such as hemostasis for epistaxis, is not included in our study.</p><p>5- One of the major concerns of the use of FMAL is gastric insufflation. Malpositioning might occur despite seemingly uneventful FMLA placement. What was the percentage rate of gastric insufflation in the study cohort?</p><p>We didn&#x02019;t find any gastric regurgitation or aspiration related to gastric insufflation. In our practice, we ensure that there was no gastric insufflation before oropharyngeal leak pressure (OLP) was arrived by auscultation over the epigastrium, and make sure that the oropharyngeal leak pressure (OLP) is at least 5 cm H2O greater than peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) during Positive pressure ventilation to avoid air leakage or gastric insufflation.(method section, from line 115 to line 119) (For a patient with normal BMI, the PIP is usually around 12 to 16 cm H2O, and the OLP is more than 24 cm H2O, so this strategy is realistic). However, gastric insufflation was not continuously monitored during the operation in our clinical practice. Asymptomatic gastric insufflation might be underestimated in our study, and we consider that the FLMA with a gastric drainage aperture is a better choice for FESS. We discuss this point from line 259 to line 262.</p><p>6- From the FESS surgeons perspective the rotation of the patient&#x02019;s head is crucial to achieve good surgical outcomes. Was rotation of the patient&#x02019;s head the most the direct reason for secondary failure?</p><p>Yes, the rotation of the patient&#x02019;s head is crucial to provide better surgical view for FESS surgeons. Before the surgical procedure, the surgical preparation of covering over the patient's head with a sterile treatment sheet needs to lift the patients head. The flexed neck position decreases the space of oropharyngeal cavity and might impact the LMA ventilation[2, 3]. After disinfection and surgical drape, the surgeon usually rotates the patient's head 10 to 15 degrees towards him to facilitate the surgical manipulation. 14(0.2%) secondary FLMA failure happened in this period in our study. We performed ETT immediately without interrupt the surgical manipulation during this period. In our clinical practice in general anesthesia for ear surgery, which should rotate the patient's head 70 degrees to the opposite side, together with others report, we&#x02019;ve found that this rotation does not impact FLMA ventilation if the FLMA is in the optimal position. So we consider that if the FLMA has a suboptimal lodgement in the oesophageal inlet, displacement is apt to occur when the swallowing reflex recovers or the head and neck position changes, resulting in FLMA dislodgement and ventilation failure. Further studies should focus on whether suboptimal positioning of the FLMA is related to secondary failure during surgery (line 294 to line 300).</p><p>7. - The authors should elaborate and extend the section on advantages of FMLA to underline the key adavantages of the FMLA over EET. Furthermore, a clarification of the main differences between the FMLA and the conventional laryngeal mask should be included as the non-anesthetist readership might not be completely aware why the conventional mask is not applicable in FESS.</p><p>We added more detailed information to describe FLMA and its advantage in FESS compared to ETT and conventional laryngeal mask in the first paragraph (line 54 to line 62)</p><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>1. </p><p>1.1 Abstract:In the objective section the primary aim is not mentioned but states safety and efficiency.What is the main objective? The authors should clarify it.</p><p>In abstract, we clarify our main objective, that is we conducted a retrospective study to evaluate the success rate of FLMA and relevant airway complications in FESS under general anaesthesia (line 23 to line 24).</p><p>1.2. in methods though Primary outcome was the success rate, the secondary aim does not specify clinical factors which are related to the failure. Authors needs to be clarify it to avoid confusion</p><p>We clarify the clinical factors from line 27 to 29</p><p>1.3 Conclusion: Instead of reporting the results of primary outcome, authors conclude on FLMA safety and efficacy. In the second sentence the author&#x02019;s mention that the intra operative failure is uncommon. But failed to the failure rate. I don&#x02019;t know what the latter half of the sentence means: &#x0201c;detected quickly and handled immediately&#x0201d;. The data or text in the results doesn&#x02019;t support it.</p><p>We&#x02019;ve changed our conclusion. We&#x02019;ve confirmed our successful rate in the first sentence. This is our first time to report a retrospective study, and we are easy to mix our results and our subjective view. We&#x02019;ve made a better revision of the manuscript.</p><p>2. Methods: What is EEG? </p><p>This sentence has been cancelled.</p><p>3. Methodology is inadequate. Inclusion criteria is only the time period of data collected but doesn&#x02019;t give other details. Inclusion or exclusion criteria doesn&#x02019;t mention on patients who had FESS with ETT. </p><p>From line 92 to line 132, we&#x02019;ve almost re-organized the method section. We&#x02019;ve made the inclusion and exclusion criteria clearer in detail, and we clarify the primary outcome and secondary outcome. We&#x02019;ve described the method of data reservation and collection. </p><p>4. In results in line 145 the some details were given. Example: 129 (1.9%) were scheduled for ETT. Then line 88: what I can understand is the departmental standardised GA options. It is not clear whether it&#x02019;s their departmental protocol. If it is, whether it was applied in all cases by all the anaesthetists. Doesn&#x02019;t mention on non-availability of data in exclusion criteria.</p><p>In method section, from line 116 to line 118 in method section, We&#x02019;ve described that general anaesthesia for FESS is standardized without being very particular, and we&#x02019;ve described our anesthetic management in detain from line 136 to line 163. Data in exclusion criteria was list in in method section from line 93 to line 98 and result section from line 187 to line 193. </p><p>5. Line 104: can&#x02019;t understand what authors want to say. What is lead around the patient neck?</p><p>It has been revised to &#x0201c;air leakage around the patient&#x02019;s mouth.&#x0201d;</p><p>6. Results: Line 144,149,-153: 6661 patients were initiated and final success of FLMA was 6512.</p><p>The number do not add up to the figure of 6512. Based on the failures (89+60+14+46=209) it should be 6452. Please check.</p><p>In result section, from line 187 to line 193: The remaining 6661 patients were initiated with the FLMA, among whom 89 (1.3%) experienced primary failure after induction, and the primary success rate was 98.7%. 60 (0.9%) cases experienced secondary failure during surgical manipulation, among whom 14 (0.2%) occurred during surgical preparation when the position of the patient&#x02019;s head and neck was changed, and 46 (0.7%) occurred during the intraoperative procedure. Final success of FLMA was achieved in 6512 cases (97.8%). Failures (89+14 +46=149). Success (6661-149=6512). Maybe in our original it does not describe the numbers clearly. We&#x02019;ve checked the numbers and revised the description.</p><p>7. Table 1 only one p value (0.008) was given for all LMAs. Is it different for all sizes? </p><p>Similarly for ASA grade, does one p value &#x0003c;0.001 applies to all grades?</p><p>Patients with and without FLMA failure were compared according to demographic and clinical characteristics by Pearson&#x02019;s Chi-square test or Fisher&#x02019;s exact test for categorical variables.(line 168 to line 169 in statistics section). In this study, we used Pearson&#x02019;s Chi-square test or Fisher&#x02019;s exact test to compare the successful rate among multiple groups (LMA size, or ASA grade). The statistic result can only show there is significant difference among the multiple groups. Thus, LMA size and ASA grade was considered a factor, and was entered into the logistic regression analysis. We didn't do Pairwise comparison to evaluate the specific differences between the two groups, which was unnecessary. Statistics method was from the relevance of Wang J, et al[4]. We&#x02019;ve revised Table 1. </p><p>8. Table 3 the total respiratory adverse events given as (n) 56 nerve. Adverse events under this subheading are they different to above total? If it is 56 then events mentioned do not add up. The subheading on tissue damage adverse events are immediate and delayed complications, suggest change of wording.</p><p>We&#x02019;ve already change the complication to immediate respiratory adverse events and delayed complication. Both were airway complications in FESS in this study.</p><p>9 Discussion: under safety and efficacy: did all cases were compliant in maintaining the OLP and PIP difference of 5H20. Line 226 mentions inadequate relaxation, whether neuromuscular monitoring was carried out? </p><p>Yes, all cases were compliant in oropharyngeal leak pressure (OLP) at least 5 cm H2O greater than peak inspiratory pressure (PIP), because .(method section, line 119 to line 120). Neuromuscular monitoring was not carried out for all cases and inadequate relaxation was our opinion. In our opinion, we consider that both surgical manipulation of the head and neck and insufficient muscle relaxation could lead to an abrupt increase in PIP, FLMA displacement and FLMA ventilation failure(line 288 to line 294). Because additional muscle relaxant could decrease the abruptly increased PIP in some of the medical chart.</p><p>10. Line 227- 233: Author&#x02019;s mentions sometimes reducing tidal volume and increasing respiratory frequency were required. Is it author&#x02019;s opinion on its management or speculation what occurred? </p><p>It is author&#x02019;s opinion on the anesthesia management. In order to reduce PIP, apart from additional muscle relaxant, we usually reduce tidal volume, by which we keep the difference between OLP and PIP. But it is our opinion, and we&#x02019;ve cancelled it in the discussion section.</p><p>11. The line 246: previous study is on prevalence, risk factors, and management of asthma in China: a national cross-sectional study. I don&#x02019;t understand the relevance here as this is FESS study assessing the safety and efficacy of the airway.</p><p>We want to compare the incidence (8.4%) of coexisting asthma observed in our study to a previous study of a Chinese adult population (4.2%). We want to show that the incidence of asthma are twice of the adult population.We&#x02019;ve cancelled reference here.</p><p>12. Awake FLMA: what&#x02019;s the relevance in your retrospective study? Has the authors conducted any such procedures?</p><p>It is not awake FLMA, is awake FLMA removal. But the sentence is confusing. We&#x02019;ve changed to &#x0201c;Additionally, we suggest that the FLMA should be removed when the patient is fully conscious after FESS.&#x0201d; (line 346 to line 347)</p><p>13. Line 260 and 261 contradicts. If not documented in the medical chart, then is it author&#x02019;s opinion?</p><p>Yes, it&#x02019;s our opinion, so we use &#x0201c;our experience&#x0201d; to describe the reason of laryngospasm (line 335). Because the adverse event such as laryngospasm and bronchospasm and the relevant treatment is automatically record in the electronic anesthesia system, but the reason should be investigated later and manually added in the medical chart. Not all cases had the detailed reasons for laryngospasm in the medical chart. </p><p>14. In results there were two patients had laryngospasm had NPPE. Describing their management in discussion may not be necessary?</p><p>Management has been cancelled.</p><p>15. Line 281: says no life threatening damage, but authors mentioned 5 such cases. It contradicts the previous statement. </p><p>We&#x02019;ve cancelled this statement here, and we thought the statement here was not appropriate. There were life-threatening damage cases in FESS under general in our study. But not all life-threatening complications are directly related to FLMA usage and we discussed them above. </p><p>16. Limitations paragraph is mixed with limits and many improvement suggestions for the future. It&#x02019;s confusing to the readers. </p><p>We&#x02019;ve re-organized our limitation from line 357 to 373, and the improvement suggestions for the future were put into the discussion section.</p><p>17. Line 301: ranks top: superlative may be avoided</p><p>It has been avoided</p><p>18. Conclusion: please refer to the comment in the abstract.</p><p>We&#x02019;ve descrived the primary outcome and secondary outcome from line 381 to line 386.</p><p>Reference</p><p>1.

</p><p>Dear Editor, </p><p>I greatly appreciate you and the reviewers for all the comments, critiques and efforts to help optimize our manuscript. Both the editor and reviewers suggest that our manuscript requires a thorough grammatical and spelling review by a native English speaker to improve its readability. We asked American Journal Experts (AJE) to help us. Our manuscript has been edited by the highly qualified native English speaking editors at American Journal Experts (AJE), and the AJE certification has been uploaded a file. </p><p>During the first communication, we think that we misunderstand the query No.8 of Reviewer #2, and we&#x02019;ve made a better revision in this manuscript. We are happy to respond to the comments. </p><p>Our point-by-point responses are listed below.</p><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>1 Table 3 the total respiratory adverse events given as (n) 56 nerve. Adverse events under this subheading are they different to above total? If it is 56 then events mentioned do not add up. The subheading on tissue damage adverse events are immediate and delayed complications, suggest change of wording.</p><p>The query no 8 is not answered. Table 3 the total respiratory adverse events given as (n) 56 The events given do not add up to 56.</p><p>In the original manuscript, we thought the delayed complications such as sore throat and soft tissue injuries were respiratory adverse events. We think it is unappropriated and we&#x02019;ve made a better Table 3 for respiratory adverse events, and the number adds up to 56.</p><p>2. Many language or grammatical mistakes, which I cannot go thru each one. Example given below. If FLMA ventilation failed after three insertion attempts during the induction period, ETT was immediately performed</p><p>Line 150 May be reworded as: If FLMA ventilation failed after three insertion attempts during the induction period, patient was immediately intubated with ETT</p><p>Line 156 ETT was implemented</p><p>Suggest rewording: intubated with ETT</p><p>Thank you for pointing out our language and grammatical mistakes. We should pay more attention on the fluency of our manuscript. We&#x02019;ve asked the highly qualified native English speaking editors at American Journal Experts (AJE) for editing services, including grammar, phrasing and punctuations. We've revised many language and grammatical mistakes.</p><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0245521.s004"><label>Attachment</label><caption><p>Submitted filename: <named-content content-type="submitted-filename">12-19-Response to Reviewers.docx</named-content></p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0245521.s004.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></body></sub-article><sub-article id="pone.0245521.r005" article-type="editor-report"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0245521.r005</article-id><title-group><article-title>Decision Letter 2</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Psaltis</surname><given-names>Alkis James</given-names></name><role>Academic Editor</role></contrib></contrib-group><permissions><copyright-statement>&#x000a9; 2021 Alkis James Psaltis</copyright-statement><copyright-year>2021</copyright-year><copyright-holder>Alkis James Psaltis</copyright-holder><license xlink:href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"><license-p>This is an open access article distributed under the terms of the <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/">Creative Commons Attribution License</ext-link>, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original author and source are credited.</license-p></license></permissions><related-article id="rel-obj005" ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.1371/journal.pone.0245521" related-article-type="reviewed-article"/><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>Submission Version</meta-name><meta-value>2</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></front-stub><body><p>
