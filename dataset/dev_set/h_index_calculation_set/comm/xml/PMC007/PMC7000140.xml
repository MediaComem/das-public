The most common laminopathy (<italic>LMNA</italic>-related myopathies, <italic>LMNA-RM</italic>) affects skeletal and cardiac muscles; muscle histopathology is variable, ranging from mild unspecific changes to dystrophic features, sometimes with inflammatory evidence. Whether the genetic defect might activate innate immune components, leading to chronic inflammation, myofiber necrosis and fibrosis, is still unknown. By qPCR, a significant up-regulation of Toll-like receptor (TLR) 7 and 9 transcripts was found in <italic>LMNA</italic>-RM compared to other myopathic and non-myopathic muscles. A marked TLR7/9 staining was observed on <italic>LMNA</italic>-RM blood vessels and muscle fibers and, when present, on infiltrating cells, mainly macrophages, scattered in the tissue or localized close to degenerated muscle fibers and connective tissue. Our results recognize innate immunity as a player in <italic>LMNA</italic>-RM pathogenesis.

Based on the affected tissue, laminopathies can be classified into several categories: lipodystrophies, neuropathies, dermopathies, cardiomyopathies and muscular dystrophies [<xref rid="CIT0002">2</xref>]. Muscular phenotypes associated with <italic>LMNA</italic> mutations (<italic>LMNA</italic>-RM) include three main groups based on the distribution of muscle weakness or age at onset: limb-girdle muscular dystrophy type 1B (LGMD1B), Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy type 2 (EDMD2) and a form of congenital muscular dystrophy (<italic>LMNA</italic>-CMD) [<xref rid="CIT0003">3</xref>]. In <italic>LMNA</italic>-RM affected subjects, histological findings in the muscle tissue are very variable ranging from mild and unspecific changes to dystrophic features, sometimes with inflammatory infiltrates [<xref rid="CIT0004">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="CIT0006">6</xref>]. Of note, inflammatory cells, which may be scattered or localized close to degenerated myofibers and to connective tissue deposits, seem to be more frequent in muscle samples taken from <italic>LMNA</italic>-RM patients with onset in the first years of life than in muscles from <italic>LMNA</italic>-RM patients with adult onset [<xref rid="CIT0004">4</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0007">7</xref>].</p><p>As recently demonstrated in Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) [<xref rid="CIT0008">8</xref>], genetic defect may affect muscle fiber structure and promote the release of adjuvant stimuli triggering the activation of innate and adaptive immune responses. Regarding laminopathies, it was demonstrated that myoblasts from <italic>LMNA</italic> mutated patients secrete high levels of inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-6 and IL-8 [<xref rid="CIT0009">9</xref>], resembling senescent cells [<xref rid="CIT0010">10</xref>] or persistently damaged cells [<xref rid="CIT0011">11</xref>]. This ongoing inflammatory state might recruit and activate immune cells as well as Toll-like receptors (TLRs) contributing to muscle degeneration, and strongly influencing the development of muscle fibrosis [<xref rid="CIT0012">12</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0013">13</xref>]. TLRs, particularly TLR4, TLR7 and TLR9, are mainly expressed by macrophages, and other lymphocytes, e.g. myeloid dendritic cells; once activated, they trigger a cascade of signaling pathways leading to the induction of several pro- or anti-inflammatory cytokine genes. In genetic muscular disorders, especially in DMD, the increased and persistent presence of macrophages, in addition to the over-expression of TLR7, it has been proposed to highly contribute to myofiber necrosis and fibrosis [<xref rid="CIT0008">8</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0012">12</xref>]. The switch from pro- to anti-inflammatory macrophage phenotype and the continuous release of TGF-&#x003b2;, promote fibroblast proliferation and connective tissue deposition, in addition to the increase availability of proline for collagen synthesis [<xref rid="CIT0014">14</xref>].</p><p>Recent reports provided evidence for a critical role of lamins in muscle differentiation [<xref rid="CIT0002">2</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0015">15</xref>]. Indeed, mutated lamin A/C or emerin negatively affect the expression of genes necessary for muscle cell differentiation, such as MyoD, desmin, pRb and M-cadherin [<xref rid="CIT0016">16</xref>].</p><p>In view of these considerations, in the present work we proposed to evaluate the expression and localization of endosomal TLR7 and TLR9 in a group of <italic>LMNA</italic>-RM affected patients, featuring both dystrophic and myopathic phenotype and distinct age of onset. We further characterized the discernible inflammatory cells in order to assess the percentage of TLR7/9 positive immune cells. Finally, we evaluated the expression of TGF-&#x003b2; and its potential relationship with damaged muscle fibers. <italic>LMNA</italic>-RM data were compared to those obtained in sporadic inclusion body myositis (sIBM) and facio-scapulo-humeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD), considered as pathological controls. sIBM is an inflammatory myopathy, characterized by a massive muscle infiltration of mononuclear cells and an activation of innate immunity TLR-mediated [<xref rid="CIT0017">17</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0018">18</xref>]; FSHD represents a genetically heterogeneous form of muscle dystrophy, characterized histologically by a myopathic or dystrophic muscle with mononuclear cell infiltrates [<xref rid="CIT0019">19</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0020">20</xref>]. Furthermore, it has been demonstrated that <italic>DUX4</italic> expression in muscle cells is involved in the regulation of immune mediators, such as TLR4 [<xref rid="CIT0021">21</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="S0002"><title>Results</title><sec id="S0002-S2001"><title>Increase of TLR7 and TLR9 mRNA expression levels in <italic>LMNA</italic>-RM and sIBM compared to FSHD and control muscles</title><p>At first we evaluated the mRNA expression levels of TLR7, TLR9 and TLR4 in muscle tissue of <italic>LMNA</italic>-RM patients and the results were compared with those obtained from sIBM, FSHD and non-myopathic control muscles (<xref rid="F0001">Figure 1</xref>).

The mechanisms by which the nearly ubiquitously expressed lamins A and C (and also emerin) can cause such tissue-specific phenotypes are not well understood, although different hypotheses have been suggested [<xref rid="CIT0002">2</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0028">28</xref>].</p><p>Muscle inflammatory findings have been already reported in <italic>LMNA</italic>-RM, especially in patients with early presentation [<xref rid="CIT0004">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="CIT0007">7</xref>]. As supposed for DMD [<xref rid="CIT0008">8</xref>], the genetic defect might determine also in <italic>LMNA</italic>-RM the activation of an innate immune response, leading to inflammation and contributing to myofiber necrosis and fibrosis. Recent reports showed that mutations in lamins and lamin-binding proteins are usually associated with the activation of the transcription factor NF-&#x003ba;B and secretion of high levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines [<xref rid="CIT0029">29</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0030">30</xref>]. Considering that NF-&#x003ba;B activation represents an important step in TLR signaling pathways [<xref rid="CIT0031">31</xref>], and taking into account the involvement of TLR7 and TLR9 in the pathogenesis of dystrophin-deficient skeletal muscle [<xref rid="CIT0008">8</xref>], in this study we proposed to evaluate the presence and the expression levels of endosomal TLRs in <italic>LMNA</italic>-RM muscle tissue. We found a significant increase in the mRNA expression levels of TLR7 and TLR9 in <italic>LMNA</italic>-RM muscles, when compared to controls and to other forms of myopathies such as FSHD. <italic>LMNA</italic>-RM muscle biopsies showed intense TLR7 and TLR9 staining, mainly localized at the level of muscle fibers and of discernible mononuclear inflammatory cells. Within <italic>LMNA</italic>-RM muscle group, we did not observe a significant difference in the TLR7/9 expression between dystrophic and myopathic histological phenotype. In <italic>LMNA</italic>-RM dystrophic muscles, we found a slight increase in TLR7/9 immunoreactivity compared to the myopathic subgroup; this was probably due to the presence of necrotic fibers and/or connective tissue deposits, less common in the myopathic muscles. Likewise, neither the different age of onset of the disease nor the different time lapse between the onset and the biopsy, seem to affect TLR7/9 expression.</p><p>Altogether our findings suggest that, independently from the clinical and histological phenotype, alteration of the nuclear lamin architecture might have a more substantial role in the activation of a TLR7/9-dependent immune response compared to other forms of neuromuscular genetic disorders, such as FSHD.</p><p>In most forms of skeletal muscle injury the main inflammatory cell type, expressing TLR7/TLR9, is represented by macrophages [<xref rid="CIT0013">13</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0032">32</xref>]. They release several cytokines, chemokines and extracellular proteases that affect satellite cell behavior, extracellular matrix remodeling and various aspects of skeletal muscle repair [<xref rid="CIT0032">32</xref>]. In order to better understand if macrophages were the main source of TLR7/TLR9 in the <italic>LMNA</italic>-RM muscle tissue, we characterized the few discernable immune cells in our group of <italic>LMNA</italic>-RM muscle biopsies. Indeed, besides few CD11c positive myeloid dendritic cells and CD4 positive T lymphocytes and rare CD138 positive plasma cells, the majority of mononuclear immune cells was composed by CD68 positive macrophages.</p><p>A recent study, performed in a <italic>LMNA</italic> mouse model, demonstrated that a mutation in the <italic>LMNA</italic> gene cause structural lesions of the nuclear laminae in macrophages [<xref rid="CIT0033">33</xref>]. These nuclear changes induced a modification of the adhesive properties of macrophages and promote the production of TGF-&#x003b2; and TNF-&#x003b1;. Furthermore, considering that the persistent activation of TLR7/9 has been shown to push macrophages into phagocytic long-lived cells, characterized by a decrease capacity of antigen presentation and a pronounced inclination to produce TGF-&#x003b2; [<xref rid="CIT0023">23</xref>], we proposed to evaluate the expression of TGF-&#x003b2; also in <italic>LMNA</italic>-RM muscle biopsies. We found that approximately 30% of muscle fibers showed a TGF-&#x003b2; positive immunoreactivity, as well as the majority of CD68 positive macrophages. Therefore, these results suggest a contribution of TGF-&#x003b2;1 to muscle damage not only in DMD, but also in <italic>LMNA</italic>-RM muscle tissue.</p><p>In summary, our data add a further insight in the pathogenesis of <italic>LMNA</italic>-RM, demonstrating that <italic>LMNA</italic>-RM muscle tissue is characterized by the over-expression of TLR7 and TLR9, probably due to the release of danger signals, as supposed for DMD, or to a NF-&#x003ba;B signaling impairment. Our findings suggest that TLR persistent activation, in addition to mutations in <italic>LMNA</italic> gene, induces substantial modifications in the behavior not only of muscle cells but also of macrophages residing in <italic>LMNA</italic>-RM muscle tissue. Both cell types are pushed to secrete several pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines, mainly TGF-&#x003b2;, promoting an impairment in muscle regeneration and favoring muscle fibrosis. Therefore, blocking or modulation of TLR7/9 signaling pathway may have important therapeutic implications for <italic>LMNA</italic>-RM.</p></sec><sec id="S0004"><title>Patients and methods</title><sec id="S0004-S2001"><title>Patients and muscle biopsies</title><p>Nine patients affected by <italic>LMNA</italic>-RM clinically and genetically defined (mean age at muscle biopsy: 30.37&#x000a0;years, ranging from 1.5 to 54), 8 patients with clinically-defined or probable sporadic inclusion body myositis (sIBM) (mean age at muscle biopsy: 66.12&#x000a0;years, ranging from 57 to 79), according to the European Neuromuscular Centre diagnostic criteria [<xref rid="CIT0024">24</xref>], 6 patients affected by facio-scapulo-humeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD) (mean age at muscle biopsy: 45.71&#x000a0;years, ranging from 34 to 66) and 14 controls (mean age at muscle biopsy: 50.82&#x000a0;years, ranging from 31 to 63), who underwent biopsy for diagnostic purposes, but without myopathy confirmation, were included in the study.
