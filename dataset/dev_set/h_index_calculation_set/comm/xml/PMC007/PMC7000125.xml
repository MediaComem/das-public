Recent advances in sequencing technologies and computational analyses now enable us to specifically probe the human immune repertoire transcriptome, which provides a new window into immune function. This surge in data collection has led to an increasing focus on personalized medicine, where an individual's personal and medical histories are combined to create a comprehensive outlook on health status and inform both preventive medical care and medical treatment (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). What has remained unclear is the stability of a healthy human immune repertoire over time and how natural infections affect this normal immune baseline.</p><p>Prior studies centered on analyzing the human B cell repertoire have often focused on either a specific immunological challenge (2, 3, 4) or the B cell subset-specificity of complementarity-determining region 3s (CDR3s), the hypervariable region of the antibody protein responsible for determining antigen-binding specificity (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>); these regions are formed by random combinations of the variable (V), diversity (D), and joining (J) gene segments (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). However, having a focused approach has specific limitations. In the case of disease-associated analyses, most experiments were performed on bulk B cells, resulting in the loss of valuable information about cellular subsets. Whereas experiments designed to analyze B cell subset-specific CDR3<xref ref-type="fn" rid="G1"><sup>1</sup></xref> properties avoid this issue, the sampling resolution was usually restricted to a single blood draw from participating individuals, resulting in a static perspective on an otherwise dynamic system. Studies that combine both multi-time point sampling of an immune challenge event on sorted B cell subsets are becoming more common (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>), but understanding the B cell repertoire of healthy individuals over time (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>) and through infection is quite rare. As a result, our understanding of the antibody repertoire across different B cell subsets, its stability over time, how it changes during natural viral infection is limited.</p><p>To address this, we longitudinally profiled an individual's immune repertoire in a subset-specific manner through two natural infection events. This approach has several advantages: 1) having access to a motivated individual allows higher sample number and consistency; 2) large sample numbers allow for increased confidence in identifying patterns in fluctuating signals while giving higher resolution to potentially low-level or rare observations; 3) the longer an individual is studied, the greater the chance of observing both healthy and natural infection periods, enabling the study of altered conditions in the same person (1); and 4) having well-defined periods of infection (<italic>e.g.</italic> elevated hs-CRP, white blood cell, and neutrophil percentage levels) enables correlation of particular immune repertoire changes to either healthy or aberrant function.</p><p>Additionally, we sorted bulk peripheral blood B cells into four distinct subsets because: 1) the majority of total B cells are from the na&#x000ef;ve subset (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>), leading to an overrepresentation of this population in data collected from unsorted samples; 2) bulk B cell characterization masks subset-specific data that differentiates between B cell developmental stages and antigen na&#x000ef;vete <italic>versus</italic> experience (<italic>i.e.</italic> immature and na&#x000ef;ve <italic>versus</italic> memory and plasmacyte cells (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>)); and 3) examining antibody sequence data of B cells at different developmental stages through both time and differing health statuses shows how the immune repertoire is affected and what changes are made during responses, especially relative to original antigenic sin (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>).</p><p>Here, we analyzed targeted RNA sequencing data derived from the CDR3s of flow cytometry-sorted healthy human B cell subsets through two natural viral infections over the course of 11 months. Through our approach, we characterized B cell response dynamics at high resolution in both healthy and disease states of the same individual. We found that 1) antibody repertoires have both common and unique features across the different B cell subsets over time in a healthy individual; 2) a given CDR3 could be generated from more than one VJ gene segment combination; 3) an individual's V gene usage preferences are stable through time and natural infection across B cell subsets; and 4) class-switched antibodies (<italic>i.e.</italic> IgG and IgA) are found at low levels in early human B cell development, suggesting that class switching occur may earlier than previously thought. These findings provide fundamental insights into human immune system development, stability and response.</p><sec sec-type="methods"><title>EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES</title><sec><title/><sec><title/><sec><title>Experimental Design and Statistical Rationale</title><p>The study subject was a healthy 59-year-old Caucasian male with a well-documented medical history; the Stanford Administrative Panel of Human Subjects in Medical Research approved his participation. At each of 24 time points over a period of 11 months, 10 ml of blood were collected via venipuncture into EDTA Vacutainer tubes (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA) after fasting between the hours of 7:00 am and 10:00 am Pacific Standard Time (PST) to standardize the effects of circadian rhythm on leukocytes (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). In addition, the subject communicated any feelings of illness experienced, including but not limited to fever, sore throat, body aches, and general malaise. During these time points, nasopharyngeal swabs were collected from the subject and genotyped using the GenMark Diagnostics eSensor Respiratory Viral Panel kit and cartridges (Carlsbad, CA), which are FDA cleared for 14 common respiratory virus types and subtypes. Clinical blood work done by the Stanford Clinical and Translational Research Unit (CTRU) were also utilized to further confirm the subject's self-reported health status.</p><p>All raw sequence data was submitted to iRepertoire, Inc. (Huntsville, AL) as FASTQ files for analysis with their customized, in-house pipeline. Raw data was analyzed using the previously described iRmap program (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). Briefly, sequence reads were de-multiplexed according to barcode sequences at the 5&#x02032; end of reads from the B-cell receptor (BCR) heavy constant regions. Reads were then trimmed according to their base qualities with a 2-base sliding window. If either quality value in this window was lower than 20, these sequence stretches from the window to 3&#x02032; end were trimmed from the original read. Trimmed paired-end reads were joined through overlapping alignment with a modified Needleman-Wunsch algorithm. If paired forward and reverse reads in the overlapping region were not perfectly matched, both forward and reverse reads were thrown out without further consideration. The merged reads were mapped using a Smith-Waterman algorithm to germline V, D, J, and C reference sequences downloaded from the IMGT web site (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). To define the CDR3 region, the position of CDR3 boundaries of reference sequences from the IMGT database were migrated onto reads through mapping results, and the resulting CDR3 regions were extracted and bioinformatically translated into amino acids.</p><p>For the purposes of this study, we further filtered the iRepertoire-analyzed data by eliminating 1) any predicted non-functional CDR3 sequences and 2) any CDR3s that were not observed four or more times from further downstream analysis per the company's recommendation. Where only three of the four subsets are used, we purposefully chose to leave out the plasmacyte subset because of low cell numbers. Additionally, time points H1, H2?, H3, and H9 were also excluded from some of the analyses because of low sequencing depth. To increase the probability of sequencing all cells according to a Poisson distribution, all samples were minimally sequenced to a depth of five reads per cell based on the company's recommendation. Visualization of the resulting nucleic and amino acid sequences was done in IgBLAST through the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) using default parameters (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). All statistical analyses from the resulting data were done in R (version 3.3.2 (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>)) and all graphs generated from these analyses were done with the R package <italic>ggplot2</italic> (version 2.2.1; <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>).</p><p>To determine if there were significant differences in CDR3 amino acid length, the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) test was used. In the case of amino acid usage, the &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup> test was utilized. To compare between healthy and sick V gene distributions, the Kruskal-Wallis test was used. For subset differences between V gene usage, the &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup> test was implemented. For both the comparison of isotype distributions between immature and na&#x000ef;ve B cells, the Wilcoxon signed rank test was used whereas the K-S test was applied to analyze isotype distribution between the immature, na&#x000ef;ve, and memory B cell subsets. Where necessary, <italic>p</italic> values were adjusted with the Benjamini-Hochberg multiple hypothesis correction. Corrected <italic>p</italic> values less than 0.05 were considered significant.</p></sec><sec><title>Sample Preparation</title><p>After collection, each blood sample underwent centrifugation at 400 &#x000d7; <italic>g</italic> for 10 min at 4 &#x000b0;C. All plasma was removed and replaced with an equivalent volume of cold 2.5 m<sc>m</sc> solution of EDTA in PBS (EDTA-PBS) (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA). The resulting reconstituted blood was then prepared for fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS).</p><p>The staining panel was designed to positively select for four B cell subsets based on developmental stages known to be present in human peripheral blood (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). Both compensation beads (BD Biosciences; Thermo Fisher Scientific - Invitrogen) and aliquots of reconstituted blood were used as negative, single color, and fluorescence-minus-one (FMO) controls and underwent the same staining procedure as described below.</p><p>All reconstituted blood cell samples and the appropriate controls were initially stained for 15 min at room temperature with the amine-reactive Zombie Aqua L/D dye (BioLegend, San Diego, CA) to discriminate between living and dead cells. The following subset-specific cell surface markers (identified by clone and fluorochrome) from BD Biosciences were then added to the samples to enable sorting of live B cell populations: anti-CD10 (HI10a; PE-CF594), anti-CD19 (SJ25C1; APC-Cy7), anti-CD27 (M-T271; PE-Cy7), anti-CD38 (HIT2; BV421), and anti-CD45 (HI30; APC) with the addition of Brilliant Buffer per the manufacturer's instructions. The stained samples were incubated on ice in the dark for 30 min. An excess volume of cold 2.5 m<sc>m</sc> EDTA-PBS with 10% FBS (Thermo Fisher Scientific) was used to wash the stained cells. All tubes were then centrifuged at 490 &#x000d7; <italic>g</italic> for 10 min at 4 &#x000b0;C. To remove red blood cells, BD Pharmlyse Lysing Buffer (BD Biosciences) was added and the samples were again incubated on ice in the dark for 30 min.

Compensation and gating strategy were performed using unstained, single color, and FMO cells in addition to unstained and single-color beads. Bulk B cells were phenotypically defined as CD45<sup>+</sup> CD19<sup>+</sup>; the four B cell subsets were further defined as follows: immature (CD10<sup>+</sup> CD27<sup>&#x02212;</sup> CD38<sup>&#x02212;</sup>), na&#x000ef;ve (CD10<sup>&#x02212;</sup> CD27<sup>&#x02212;</sup> CD38<sup>&#x02212;</sup>), memory (CD10<sup>&#x02212;</sup> CD27<sup>+</sup> CD38<sup>&#x02212;</sup>) and plasmacyte (CD10<sup>&#x02212;</sup> CD27<sup>+</sup> CD38<sup>+</sup>).

After sorting, all samples were centrifuged at 490 &#x000d7; <italic>g</italic> for 5 min at 4 &#x000b0;C and the supernatant was discarded. Cell pellets were resuspended in Buffer RLT Plus with &#x003b2;-mercaptoethanol from the AllPrep RNA/DNA Micro Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) and centrifuged through QIAshredder spin columns. All cell lysates were stored at &#x02212;80 &#x000b0;C for library preparation.</p></sec><sec><title>Targeted Immune Repertoire Sequencing</title><p>RNA was isolated from all four subsets at each time point according to the manual instructions for the AllPrep RNA/DNA Micro Kit (Qiagen). The purified RNA from all four subsets was quality checked with a Nanodrop 2000 (Thermo Fisher Scientific) before use as template material in the creation of cDNA libraries for sequencing.</p><p>To analyze the CDR3 sequences, RT-PCR reactions were conducted using a proprietary set of commercially available nested sequence-specific primers from iRepertoire Inc. covering human VH genes (forward primers) and constant C-primers (reverse primers). The Illumina paired-end sequencing communal primer B is linked to each forward inside V primer whereas the Illumina paired-end sequencing communal primer A and a barcode sequence of 6 nucleotides are linked to the reverse inside C primer. In brief, cDNA was reverse transcribed from the total RNA samples from each B cell subset using a mixture of forward V and reverse C primers and reagents from the OneStep RT-PCR kit (Qiagen).</p><p>The first round of RT-PCR was performed at: 50 &#x000b0;C, 41 min; 95 &#x000b0;C, 15 min; 94 &#x000b0;C, 30 s, 63 &#x000b0;C, 5 min, 72 &#x000b0;C, 30 s, for 10 cycles; 94 &#x000b0;C, 30 s, 72 &#x000b0;C, 3 min, for 10 cycles; 72 &#x000b0;C, 5 min. After the first round of PCR, 2 &#x003bc;l of PCR1 product was added to 48 &#x003bc;l of PCR2 Multiplex Mix (Qiagen). The second round of PCR (PCR2) was performed with a set of communal primers that complete the Illumina adaptor sequences as: 95 &#x000b0;C, 15 min; 94 &#x000b0;C, 30 s, 72 &#x000b0;C, 90 s, for 30 cycles; 72 &#x000b0;C, 5 min. After PCR2, 50 &#x003bc;l of PCR2 product was run on a 2% agarose gel to assess amplification success. Amplicon bands were excised and gel purified using a Qiaquick Gel Purification kit (Qiagen) per manufacturer's instructions.</p><p>The completed cDNA libraries were assessed for quality and quantified on the Qubit Fluorometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA) before getting pooled and submitted to the Stanford Center for Genomics and Personalized Medicine for paired-end sequencing at 2 &#x000d7; 250 bp on the Illumina MiSeq platform.</p></sec><sec><title>Examination of Published Data</title><p>To further investigate our observation of more than one VJ gene combination creating a single CDR3 sequence, we downloaded published publicly available data sets from four different studies (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref><xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr"/>&#x02013;<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>).

Further inspection of those V genes revealed that the immature and na&#x000ef;ve subsets have similar biases in usage, which is inversely related to their usage in the memory subset (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref><italic>A</italic>&#x02032;, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref><italic>B</italic>&#x02032;, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref><italic>C</italic>&#x02032;).

To this end, we collected longitudinal data from a single individual and examined the CDR3s of flow cytometry-sorted B cell subsets.</p><p>Longitudinal data is usually collected under specific immunological challenges (<italic>e.g.</italic> immunization (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>) or systemic sclerosis (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>)) with few focused on examining healthy fluctuations in the immune repertoire and transition to disease (13). In addition, many of the samples are from bulk cell populations, which limits the conclusions drawn to the strongest signals with weak or unknown contextual reference (2). Alternatively, studies of the human immune repertoire that extensively profiled B cell subsets were based on a single large volume blood draw (7, 8). Our study combines the longitudinal monitoring of both healthy time points and periods of natural infection with subset-specific analysis of the different B cell subsets for a more comprehensive approach to examining the human immune repertoire and its changes in these conditions.</p><p>To examine how B cell receptors respond to natural infection, we analyzed changes in CDR3 characteristics. As evidenced in prior studies, we observed the heavy chain CDR3 amino acid length is longest with shorter kappa and lambda chain CDR3 lengths (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref><xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr"/><xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr"/><xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr"/>&#x02013;<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>). The heavy chain CDR3 amino acid usage distribution in our data is also like that previously reported (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>, <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>). Importantly, our study highlights additional novel aspects of CDR3 biology. First, the differential amino acid usage of the kappa and lambda light chains relative to the heavy chain may indicate different antigen binding characteristics of each light chain in combination with the heavy chain (<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>), which may enable different specializations in antigen binding (<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>, <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>). Second, both CDR3 length and amino acid usage are predominantly chain-specific as opposed to subset-specific. These observations remain consistent through periods of health and natural infection, suggesting that internal selection pressures (<italic>e.g.</italic> binding affinity for self-antigens) may play an important role in shaping the intrinsic properties of the immune repertoire compared with external sources (<italic>e.g.</italic> foreign antigens).</p><p>In examining unique CDR3 amino acid sequences, we found the overlap within each of the three chain types were quite low, even across the different cell types (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref>). It is important to emphasize that monitoring unique CDR3 RNA sequences longitudinally is a different metric than monitoring B cell clonality at the amino acid level. Because memory cells and plasmacytes are both antigen-experienced populations with high levels of amino acid sequence clonality (<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>, <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>), it follows that the extrapolated lower bound for heavy chain clonotype diversity (calculated as D50 by the iRmap program; see Experimental Procedures) should be lowest for those two cell types. Our data reflects this expectation, with the immature and na&#x000ef;ve B cells having the highest diversity and the memory and plasmacyte subsets having the lowest (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.mcponline.org/cgi/content/full/RA119.001633/DC1">supplemental Table S8</ext-link>). Hence, finding a low number of common CDR3 sequences in each chain is expected.</p><p>Closer examination of the two light chains showed lower unique CDR3 sequence diversity than the heavy chain. This finding is reasonable based on the total numbers of expressed genes involved in recombination. The kappa chains in this individual utilized 40 V genes, five J genes, and one C gene; the lambda chains used 33 V genes, four J genes, and four C genes compared with the heavy chain usage of 48 V genes, six D gene families (data not shown), and six J genes. Therefore, we anticipated lower levels of combinatorial diversity in the two light chains compared with the heavy chain. Also, we found a higher overall level of kappa chain usage than lambda chain as expected (<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>).</p><p>For heavy chain CDR3 sequences, we observed that the number of unique CDR3s in each subset could serve as a proxy for relative B cell subset proportions in human peripheral blood. Additionally, over the course of almost one year, the total number of unique CDR3 predicted amino acid sequences observed across all subsets through all time points was 1,410,924. This total is far lower than other estimates (<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>), which could be explained by one or more of the following: 1) the lack of universally agreed-upon primer set designs, sequencing platforms, sequencing depth, and analysis pipelines; 2) high efficiency and low permissiveness of healthy immune homeostasis (<xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>); 3) increasing age leading to lower immune repertoire diversity (<xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref><xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr"/>&#x02013;<xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>); and/or 4) preferential usage of V and J genes (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>), leading to a lower maximum amount of diversity.</p><p>The possibility that the B cell immune repertoire is biased in V gene usage is well known (<xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>, <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>), and some genes are consistently selected. In some cases, these preferences are determined prior to foreign antigen exposure (<italic>e.g.</italic> V4&#x02013;34 and V4&#x02013;59) while other selected V genes appear to arise in response to some combination of self- and foreign antigens (<italic>e.g.</italic> V3&#x02013;23 (<xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>)). Therefore, we examined the relationship between VJ gene usage and CDR3 sequence diversity to determine if any additional V genes are preferentially used in a subset-specific manner.</p><p>We first observed that, irrespective of health status, a healthy individual's immune repertoire utilizes VJ gene combinations to diversify the resulting CDR3 sequences on the order of one VJ combination to hundreds of different CDR3s. This result aligns with both our observation and others that the relationship between VJ combinations and CDR3 sequences is not directly proportional (<xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>). Note we excluded plasmacytes from this portion of our analysis because their low abundance in peripheral blood (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>) may cause uneven sampling of the true diversity of this B cell subset. Interestingly, we found that a single CDR3 sequence may arise from several different VJ combinations, which has not been previously reported.</p><p>To further investigate this observation, we examined published datasets (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref><xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr"/>&#x02013;<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>) that also analyzed the human B cell immune repertoire.

While the possibility of alignment artifacts and/or PCR chimeras of recombinant immunoglobulin loci cannot be ruled out, we note that these events are found across multiple samples in our study as well as several publicly available independent datasets; thus, it is possible that such recombinations occur <italic>in vivo</italic> through multiple independent events, or through an <italic>in vivo</italic> gene-conversion/rearrangement process similar to that observed in avian systems (<xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>). Additional data on the VJ composition of CDR3 sequences from future studies is crucial to discerning between these possibilities.</p><p>Secondly, we observed tight control of V gene usage in each subset for the duration of our study. These subset-specific V gene preferences were maintained irrespective of health status. As a result, we identified several additional heavy chain V genes that warrant further investigation. While some of these genes are involved in human disease (<xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>, <xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>), other genes would benefit from a more in-depth analysis (V2&#x02013;5, V3&#x02013;74, and V6&#x02013;1). Additionally, we showed several kappa and lambda V genes as differentially expressed between subsets; some have human disease associations validated by the literature (<xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref><xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr"/><xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr"/>&#x02013;<xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>) whereas others merit additional study (KV2D-29, LV10&#x02013;54, LV2&#x02013;8, LV3&#x02013;1, LV3&#x02013;25, LV4&#x02013;60, LV4&#x02013;69).</p><p>Another surprising finding of our study is direct evidence of class switching in the immature and na&#x000ef;ve B cell subset. This result has not been reported previously and suggests that class switching may occur earlier in human B cell development than previously realized. One of the earliest observations of class switching during early human B cell development was reported by Vogler <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>) in pre-B cells isolated from children diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Using immunofluorescence assays, they found cytoplasmic IgG and IgA in 0.1&#x02013;3.6% and 0.7% of leukemic lymphoblasts, respectively, across several patients. Our observations suggest some amount of class switching at the transcriptional level may also occur early in healthy individuals. In addition, the RNA-editing enzyme activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID) required for both class switch recombination (CSR) and somatic hypermutation (<xref rid="B58" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>) is present in both immature and na&#x000ef;ve B cells of mice and humans (<xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr">59</xref><xref rid="B60" ref-type="bibr"/><xref rid="B61" ref-type="bibr"/><xref rid="B62" ref-type="bibr"/><xref rid="B63" ref-type="bibr"/>&#x02013;<xref rid="B64" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>) with reports that class switching in early B cell development does occur in mice (<xref rid="B61" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>, <xref rid="B65" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>, <xref rid="B66" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>).</p><p>Another possible explanation for our observation is subset contamination, which we assessed by examining 1) our flow sorting experimental design; 2) the observed class-switched CDR3 sequences; and 3) publicly available datasets from single-cell B cell receptor experiments. For the flow cytometry experiments, we designed our stain panel to maximize both fluorochrome and laser separation for each surface marker. Also, we chose a conservative gating strategy to reduce the inclusion of other cell types and consistently employed backgating to ensure the desired subsets fell squarely within expected clusters. We phenotypically defined immature B cells via surface markers as CD45<sup>+</sup>CD19<sup>+</sup>CD10<sup>+</sup>CD27<sup>&#x02212;</sup>, whereas the na&#x000ef;ve subset was similarly defined except for being CD10<sup>&#x02212;</sup>. It should be noted that we cannot rule out the possibility that some number of the isotype-switched na&#x000ef;ve cells may be the result of isotype-switched immature cells that matured into na&#x000ef;ve cells. There is a possibility that transitional B cells were co-sorted with the immature cells as are both CD10<sup>+</sup>CD27<sup>&#x02212;</sup> (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="B67" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>). However, considering both the immature and transitional subsets are 1) CD10<sup>+</sup>, which has been accepted as one of the hallmarks of early peripheral blood B cells (<xref rid="B67" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>), 2) have the potential to initiate CSR (<xref rid="B61" ref-type="bibr">61</xref><xref rid="B62" ref-type="bibr"/>&#x02013;<xref rid="B63" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>), and 3) can be ruled out as being recirculating memory B cells (<xref rid="B68" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>) by surface CD10 expression, we are confident that we are observing transcriptional evidence of isotype-switching in early human B cells.</p><p>Next, we focused on examining the CDR3 sequences of the immature and naive B cells that we identified as class-switched. We expected that the higher the percentage of CDR3 amino acid sequence overlap, the higher the likelihood of contamination from another cell subset. To this end, we first assessed the number of class-switched CDR3s found in the immature and na&#x000ef;ve subsets that were present in more than one cell type. Our results indicate that most class-switched CDR3s from the immature and na&#x000ef;ve populations were subset-unique.</p><p>Finally, we examined single-cell B cell sequencing experiments to determine if existing datasets could either confirm or refute our observation. Analyzing data obtained from individual B cells would eliminate concerns of subset contamination and ensure confident subset assignment of any class-switched B cells based on each cell's specific surface phenotype. However, in most data sets examined, we found that the B cells were not sorted. As a result, it would be impossible to determine with high confidence which B cells were immature, na&#x000ef;ve, or memory cells. As a result, any class-switched B cells could not be assigned with certainty to any of the subsets. In those experiments that did sort different B cell populations, isotype surface markers (<italic>e.g.</italic> IgM and/or IgD) were used to phenotypically define their subsets. This would have selected against any class-switched immature or naive cells that may have existed. In other cases, when we tried to access the data, the links were either broken and/or we were unable to locate the datasets within the repositories that contained them. Other published studies that used single cell sequencing to interrogate B cells have not made their data publicly available.</p><p>Despite not finding single-cell sequencing datasets that were appropriate for comparison with our study, based on our flow cytometry panel design and class-switched CDR3 sequence analysis, we are confident that, to our knowledge, this is the first reported observation of isotype switching in human early B cell development. If future studies confirm these findings, our observations would give new insights into the developmental and maturation processes of human B cells.</p><p>In conclusion, our findings demonstrate the importance of longitudinal data collection when profiling the human immune repertoire. By analyzing these data, we showed 1) V gene usage preferences are remarkably consistent based on foreign antigen exposure; 2) multiple VJ gene combinations may generate the same CDR3 amino acid sequence; and 3) transcriptional evidence of unconventional isotypes in the immature and na&#x000ef;ve B cell subsets indicates class switching may occur earlier in human B cell development, a phenomenon only observed previously in mice. Overall, we expect this work to be an in-depth proof-of-principle study for future investigations in which more individuals of different ages, genders, and ethnicities might be studied in the same manner. Such analyses will advance the field of personalized immunology.</p></sec><sec sec-type="data-availability"><title>DATA AVAILABILITY</title><p>All data generated from this study has been deposited in NCBI's Gene Expression Omnibus (69) with the GEO Series accession number <ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="GSE123158">GSE123158</ext-link> (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE123158">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE123158</ext-link>).</p></sec>
