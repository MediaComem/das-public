This systematic review evaluates studies examining the association between universal free school meals and students&#x02019; school meal participation rates, diets, attendance, academic performance, and Body Mass Index (BMI), as well as school finances. The search was conducted in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA). A search for studies published in economically developed countries published through December 2020 was performed in PubMed, Education Resources Information Center (ERIC), Thomson Reuters&#x02019; Web of Science, and Academic Search Ultimate, followed by examining the references in the resultant literature. A total of 47 studies were identified and the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS) was applied to assess bias. Nearly all studies examining universal free school meals found positive associations with school meal participation. Most studies examining universal free school meals that included free lunch found positive associations with diet quality, food security, and academic performance; however, the findings of studies examining only universal free breakfast were mixed. Research findings were similarly mixed when examining attendance as an outcome. Concerns about adverse outcomes on student BMI were not supported by the literature; in fact, several studies detected a potentially protective effect of universal free school meals on BMI. Research examining the impact of universal free meals on school finances was limited, but suggest that lower-income school districts in the U.S. may have positive financial outcomes from participation in universal free school meal provisions. Additionally, providing free meals to students may be associated with improved household incomes, particularly among lower-income families with children. Further research is needed to examine the financial implications of universal free meals for both school districts and families. Overall, universal free school meals may have multiple benefits for students and countries should consider universal free school meal provisions with strong nutrition guidelines.

Introduction</title><p>Globally, schools are recognized as an important setting to promote healthy behaviors, as children typically spend a substantial amount of their waking hours at school [<xref rid="B1-nutrients-13-00911" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="B2-nutrients-13-00911" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="B3-nutrients-13-00911" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. As children&#x02019;s eating preferences often persist into adulthood, schools can provide meaningful opportunities to promote and establish healthier diets through access to nutritious foods, including breakfast and lunch [<xref rid="B1-nutrients-13-00911" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="B4-nutrients-13-00911" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="B5-nutrients-13-00911" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="B6-nutrients-13-00911" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="B7-nutrients-13-00911" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Among countries with developed economies, school meals are a common feature of national safety net programs and typically provide students with breakfast and/or lunch with a focus on improving diet quality, particularly among low-income populations [<xref rid="B1-nutrients-13-00911" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Many countries have nutrition standards for school meals, which can have important short- and long-term health implications for children, including promoting optimal growth and cognitive development and reducing the risk of food insecurity and obesity [<xref rid="B8-nutrients-13-00911" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="B9-nutrients-13-00911" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="B10-nutrients-13-00911" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="B11-nutrients-13-00911" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="B12-nutrients-13-00911" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="B13-nutrients-13-00911" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="B14-nutrients-13-00911" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="B15-nutrients-13-00911" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="B16-nutrients-13-00911" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="B17-nutrients-13-00911" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="B18-nutrients-13-00911" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. School meal programs are commonly means-tested (e.g., based on family income, eligibility for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program [SNAP], etc.), whereby access to subsidized free or reduced-price meals are available to lower-income students. However, policies that support universal free school meals (i.e., meals provided at no cost to all children who wish to participate) are gaining attention as a strategy to reduce stigma and diet-related disparities among lower-income students, promote children&#x02019;s nutrition more broadly (school meals are often healthier than meals brought from home), and potentially lower administrative costs for schools [<xref rid="B19-nutrients-13-00911" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="B20-nutrients-13-00911" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="B21-nutrients-13-00911" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="B22-nutrients-13-00911" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="B23-nutrients-13-00911" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="B24-nutrients-13-00911" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="B25-nutrients-13-00911" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="B26-nutrients-13-00911" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="B27-nutrients-13-00911" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="B28-nutrients-13-00911" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. </p><p>Despite the potential benefits of universal free school meals, they are currently only available in a small number of countries. Beginning in 1943, Finland was the first country to offer universal free school meals, and Sweden implemented them two years later in 1945 [<xref rid="B29-nutrients-13-00911" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="B30-nutrients-13-00911" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. More recently, Estonia began providing free school meals to all students in 2002, and South Korea implemented a universal free school meal program in 2011 [<xref rid="B11-nutrients-13-00911" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="B31-nutrients-13-00911" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Additionally, England implemented the Universal Infant Free School Meals (UIFSM) policy for state-funded schools in 2014 and Scotland introduced a similar policy in 2015, both of which only apply to children in their first three years of primary school (children ages 4&#x02013;7 years at the beginning of the school year) [<xref rid="B10-nutrients-13-00911" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="B32-nutrients-13-00911" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Japan&#x02019;s school meal program, which was first implemented in 1947, is universal but not free; participation in the school meal program is mandatory, and low-income families receive financial support for school meals from the local and/or national government [<xref rid="B33-nutrients-13-00911" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,<xref rid="B34-nutrients-13-00911" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>].</p><p>In the United States, there have been multiple provisions supported by the USDA that have enabled high-poverty schools to provide universal free school breakfast and/or lunch. These include: Provision 1, Provision 2, Provision 3, and most recently, the Community Eligibility Provision (CEP) which was introduced as part of the Healthy Hunger-Free Kids Act of 2010 and became available to eligible schools nationwide in 2014 (see <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-nutrients-13-00911">Supplemental Table S1</xref> for a summary of school meal provisions in the United States) [<xref rid="B8-nutrients-13-00911" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="B35-nutrients-13-00911" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. To be eligible to opt into CEP, &#x02265;40% of students in a district or school must be from low-income households, which is determined using existing administrative data (e.g., participation in SNAP). However, in the 2019&#x02013;2020 school year, only about 69% of eligible schools in the U.S. were participating in CEP, in part due to concerns about insufficient reimbursement from the federal government [<xref rid="B36-nutrients-13-00911" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>,<xref rid="B37-nutrients-13-00911" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>].</p><p>While proponents of universal free school meals cite numerous benefits, including higher school meal participation rates and improved student diet quality, academic performance, and attendance, concerns have also been raised about the potential detrimental impact on students&#x02019; body mass index (BMI) and/or school finances [<xref rid="B38-nutrients-13-00911" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>,<xref rid="B39-nutrients-13-00911" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. To date, the research examining universal free school meals has not been systematically evaluated. A commentary by Hecht and colleagues, which included a non-systematic review of CEP in the United States, concluded that there was growing evidence of an association with positive health and academic benefits for children, but that more research was needed [<xref rid="B40-nutrients-13-00911" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. A better understanding of how universal free school meals impact students and schools can help inform school meal policies globally. Therefore, the aim of this study was to systematically review the international evidence regarding the impact of universal free school meals on students&#x02019; school meal participation rates, diets, attendance, academic performance, and body mass index (BMI), and as well as school finances.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-nutrients-13-00911"><title>2.

The protocol was registered with the PROSPERO International Prospective Register of Systematic Review prior to data extraction (protocol registration number: CRD42020221782) [<xref rid="B42-nutrients-13-00911" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>].</p><sec id="sec2dot1-nutrients-13-00911"><title>2.1. Data Sources and Search Strategies</title><p>Four online databases were used: PubMed, Education Resources Information Center (ERIC), Thomson Reuters&#x02019; Web of Science, and Academic Search Ultimate. The search strategy was comprised of combinations of the following keywords (adapted for each database): school, universal, free, community eligibility, provision, reimbursement, access, poverty, hunger, meal, breakfast, lunch. Articles in English published since the start of the literature through December 2020 were reviewed. To identify additional potentially relevant studies, a search of the reference lists of these articles as well as a review of all articles citing the resultant literature (using Google Scholar) was performed.</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot2-nutrients-13-00911"><title>2.2. Study Selection</title><p>Eligible studies were quantitative research articles evaluating universal free school meals and school meal participation rates, academic performance, attendance, Body Mass Index (BMI), diet quality, food insecurity, and/or school finances. Our inclusion criteria were English, peer-reviewed publications or official government reports within countries with developed economies (i.e., members of the Organization for Economic Co-Operation and Development [OECD]) [<xref rid="B43-nutrients-13-00911" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>], and conducted in primary (i.e., elementary) and secondary (i.e., middle, and/or high) schools during the academic year (terminology throughout reflects how grade levels are referred to within each country). Studies from Japan examining universal school meals (mandatory for all students but not free) were also included due to the similar nature of the school meal program compared with universal free school meal programs and thus research findings were considered relevant and informative. The following types of articles were excluded: non-English articles; qualitative research; articles that did not examine universal free school breakfast or lunch (e.g., snacks, milk programs, or afterschool programs); initiatives that occurred outside of the school year (i.e., holiday or summer vacations); studies conducted in non-OECD countries; and articles that only compared across different universal free school meal models (i.e., universal free breakfast offered in the cafeteria versus universal free breakfast provided in the classroom). Two independent reviewers conducted the searches and screened titles and abstracts, and the lead author (JFWC) screened full texts. Articles with unclear eligibility were reviewed by the research team. A total of 47 studies that met the inclusion criteria were identified and included in this paper (<italic>n</italic> = 25 studies conducted in the U.S. and <italic>n</italic> = 22 studies conducted in other OECD countries). Due to the heterogeneity of the study designs and outcome measures of the included studies, the data could not be combined to reanalyze as meta-analyses. Therefore, a qualitative narrative review was used to synthesize the results of the included studies.</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot3-nutrients-13-00911"><title>2.3. Quality Assessment</title><p>Assessment of study quality and biases were based on adapted Newcastle&#x02013;Ottawa Scales (NOS) for cross-sectional and cohort studies, which are commonly used to assess non-randomized research [<xref rid="B44-nutrients-13-00911" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>,<xref rid="B45-nutrients-13-00911" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>,<xref rid="B46-nutrients-13-00911" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. Each study was assessed by two authors using the following criteria: selection, comparability, and outcome. Quality assessments were interpreted based on the following categories: very high risk of bias (0&#x02013;3 points), high risk of bias (4&#x02013;6 points), and low risk of bias (&#x02265;7 points) [<xref rid="B47-nutrients-13-00911" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>].

Results</title><p>The original search of the four databases (PubMed, ERIC, Thomson Reuters&#x02019; Web of Science, and Academic Search Ultimate) identified a total of 9083 articles. After removing duplicates, 4604 articles remained. The primary screening excluded 4122 records. The full text of the remaining 156 publications were assessed in detail, and 121 articles were excluded. The primary reasons for exclusion in this step concerned the study objectives (i.e., did not aim to evaluate universal free school meals or only compared universal free school meal models), publication type (i.e., grey literature), and the location where the study was conducted (i.e., non-OECD countries). Five additional articles were identified from references or publications citing the referent literature. Therefore, a total of 47 articles were included in this review (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="nutrients-13-00911-f001">Figure 1</xref>). As seen in <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-nutrients-13-00911">Supplemental Tables S2 and S3</xref>, quality scores for the included articles ranged from 3 (very high risk of bias) to 10 (low risk of bias). Over half of the included studies (<italic>n</italic> = 26) were classified as having a low risk of bias while <italic>n</italic> = 12 articles had high risk and <italic>n</italic> = 10 articles had very high risk (one study had both high and low risk of bias for differing outcomes assessed). Research conducted in the U.S. is presented separately from other OECD countries in each section of the review due to the large number of studies and the unique nature of universal free school meal provisions in the U.S. (i.e., universal free school meals are primarily available only in lower-income schools).</p><sec id="sec3dot1-nutrients-13-00911"><title>3.1. School Meal Participation</title><p>A primary goal of universal free school meals is to increase school meal participation. Of the 11 peer-reviewed publications and four government reports conducted in the U.S. that examined school meal participation as an outcome (<italic>n</italic> = 15 studies; <xref rid="nutrients-13-00911-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>), 14 found a positive association between universal free school meals and National School Lunch Program (NSLP) or School Breakfast Program (SBP) participation and one found mixed results. One peer-reviewed study and two government reports examining universal free school meals in the United Kingdom (UK) also found positive associations with school meal participation (<xref rid="nutrients-13-00911-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). Among the studies conducted using methodology with a low risk of bias, all 11 found positive associations between universal free school meals and school meal participation rates.</p><p>In the United States, several studies have examined the impact of universal free SBP and program participation. In a study conducted by Leos-Ubel et al. in New York City among elementary and middle school students, access to universal free breakfast was positively associated with SBP participation, with rates varying by student socio-economic status (SES) [<xref rid="B48-nutrients-13-00911" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. Among students with the lowest household income levels who were already eligible for free school meals, there was an increase in participation by 5% (<italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05). Among students previously eligible for reduced-price meals, there was a 21% increase in SBP participation (<italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.01), and among students eligible for full- price meals previously, there was a 36% increase in participation (<italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.01). Similar results were observed in a study conducted by Ribar and colleagues in a school district in North Carolina where three elementary schools removed universal free breakfast while one school introduced it [<xref rid="B49-nutrients-13-00911" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. Overall, universal free breakfast was associated with 16.4% higher rates of SBP participation (<italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05), with the greatest increase in participation rates among students from higher-income households who were not previously eligible for free or reduced-price meals (27.5%; <italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05). Nearly identical results were observed in a government report examining the pilot of universal free breakfast in six school districts in six states, with schools within each district randomly assigned to universal free breakfast or control (means-tested based on eligibility for free or reduced-price meals); after one year, universal free breakfast was associated with a 16 percentage point increase in participation (<italic>p</italic> = 0.01), again, with the largest increases observed among students not previously eligible for free or reduced-price meals [<xref rid="B50-nutrients-13-00911" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. In a second government report examining the extended impact of this pilot program, the increases in participation were maintained over three years [<xref rid="B51-nutrients-13-00911" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. Another study conducted by Soldavini and associates in North Carolina elementary, middle, and high schools found that providing universal free breakfasts was positively associated with significantly greater odds of breakfast participation at all grade levels, with the exception of high school students who were previously eligible for free or reduced-price meals [<xref rid="B52-nutrients-13-00911" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. A third study by Wahlstrom et al. examining six elementary schools in Minnesota also observed high SBP participation rates among schools with universal free breakfast, although no statistical analyses were conducted and this study was assessed to have a very high risk of bias [<xref rid="B22-nutrients-13-00911" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. In a cross-sectional study conducted by Khan and colleagues in a Vermont middle school serving universal free breakfast, food-insecure students were significantly less likely to eat breakfast at home compared with food-secure students, and nearly all (91.3%) of the food-insecure students reported eating free breakfast at school [<xref rid="B53-nutrients-13-00911" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. However, a cross-sectional study in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania conducted by Dykstra et al. found that students participated in the free SBP only 31% of the time (however, changes in participation rates were not measured) [<xref rid="B54-nutrients-13-00911" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. Although there were significantly higher participation rates among minority students compared with their white peers, there were no differences in participation by eligibility for free or reduced-price meals or by food-insecurity levels.</p><p>Several studies have also examined universal free school meal provisions prior to the implementation of CEP in the U.S. One study in Texas conducted by Rivas examining a school district that implemented Provision 2 observed a 16% increase in overall school meal participation rates (although this was not analyzed for statistically significant differences and the study was considered to have a very high risk of bias) [<xref rid="B55-nutrients-13-00911" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. Similarly, in a study conducted by Schwartz et al. among middle schools in New York City, Provision 2 was positively associated with NSLP participation, with differences observed by student SES; on average there was an 11% increase in NSLP participation among students not previously eligible for school meals (<italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05) and a 5.4% increase among students from lower-income households (<italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.01) [<xref rid="B39-nutrients-13-00911" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. A government report examining a no-fee school meal pilot program in several states found an increase in lunch participation by approximately 10 percentage points (although this study was deemed to have a very high risk of bias) [<xref rid="B56-nutrients-13-00911" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. Another government report evaluating an initiative to eliminate reduced-price fees for school meals observed similar changes, with an 11% increase in lunch participation and 9% increase in breakfast participation among students previously eligible for reduced-price meals (and this study also was assessed to have a very high risk of bias) [<xref rid="B57-nutrients-13-00911" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>].</p><p>The CEP was introduced in 2010, and several studies tested its impact using pre-post designs. Pokorney et al. examined all CEP schools (<italic>n</italic> = 654) before and after implementation compared with eligible non-CEP schools (i.e., schools that chose not to participate in CEP but met the eligibility criteria [<italic>n</italic> = 1221]) in Pennsylvania and found that on average CEP was associated with an 8% increase in school lunch participation [<xref rid="B58-nutrients-13-00911" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. In sub-analyses examining participation by student SES, NSLP participation rates were higher among students not previously eligible for free or reduced-price meals, but slightly lower among lower-income students in CEP schools compared with non-CEP schools. Turner and colleagues also examined the introduction of CEP, as well as the use of Provisions 1, 2, and 3 in public schools in California, and found that universal free school meals were associated with a 5.8 percentage point increase in NSLP participation and 3.5 percentage point increase in SBP participation [<xref rid="B59-nutrients-13-00911" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. Lastly, Tan et al. used national data from K-8 schools to address this question and found that CEP was associated with an 11.7% higher likelihood of participating in the NSLP among near-cutoff students (i.e., students who were near the cutoff and had uncertain eligibility for free or reduced-price meals [<italic>p</italic> = 0.023]) and a 19% higher likelihood of participation among students previously eligible for full-price meals (<italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001) [<xref rid="B60-nutrients-13-00911" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. CEP was also associated with a 19.6% higher likelihood of participation in the SBP among students previously eligible for full-price meals in this study (<italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05).</p><p>Among research conducted in the UK, a government report examining the pilot of Universal Infant Free School Meals (UIFSM) in England among primary school students in three local authorities found that universal free school meals were associated with approximately a 30% increase in the percent of students taking a school lunch at least once a week (i.e., roughly 90% of students had a school lunch at least once week in schools with universal free school meals compared with 60% of students in matched control schools) [<xref rid="B61-nutrients-13-00911" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. The greatest increases in participation were among students who were not previously eligible for school meals. Similarly, in another government report examining universal free school meals in Scotland, school lunch participation increased by 22 percentage points (from 53% to 75%), with the greatest increases among students not previously registered for free school meals (an increase of 28 percentage points) [<xref rid="B62-nutrients-13-00911" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>]. Another study conducted in primary schools in Scotland examining universal free school meals also found the greatest increases in lunch participation were among students not previously eligible for free school meals (14.4 percentage point increase [<italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001]) [<xref rid="B63-nutrients-13-00911" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>].</p><p>To summarize, there is a large literature examining the relationship between offering universal free meals and student participation. Overall, the findings consistently show that student participation in school meal programs increases when meals are provided at no costs. Further, the increase in participation tends to be largest among students who previously did not qualify for free or reduced-price meals.</p></sec><sec id="sec3dot2-nutrients-13-00911"><title>3.2. Diet Quality and Food Insecurity</title><p>Another priority of universal free school meals is to improve the nutritional quality of children&#x02019;s diets and reduce food insecurity. In the presence of strong nutrition standards, school meals may improve children&#x02019;s diets directly by providing healthy foods (i.e., fruits, vegetables, whole grains, etc.) [<xref rid="B23-nutrients-13-00911" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="B24-nutrients-13-00911" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="B25-nutrients-13-00911" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="B26-nutrients-13-00911" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="B28-nutrients-13-00911" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="B64-nutrients-13-00911" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>]. There may be indirect benefits as well; prior research has found that healthy school meal consumption is associated with decreased intake of less healthy foods outside of school, potentially attributable to increased satiety from nutrient dense, high fiber school meals [<xref rid="B65-nutrients-13-00911" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>]. Additionally, when school meals are provided at no cost, families are able to save those funds and increase their purchasing power for other foods, further reducing food insecurity. Of the six peer-reviewed publications and one government report conducted in the U.S. that examined diet-related outcomes (<italic>n</italic> = 7 studies [<xref rid="nutrients-13-00911-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>]), two found a positive association between universal free school meals and dietary quality and two found a positive association with food security. Three studies examined only universal free breakfast and found mixed results with diet quality. Among the 19 studies conducted in other OECD countries (18 peer-reviewed and one government report [<xref rid="nutrients-13-00911-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>]), including the UK, Denmark, Norway, Japan, Greece, and New Zealand, 13 found improvements in students&#x02019; dietary outcomes and three found no association. Of the three studies that examined food insecurity, two studies found improvements and one found no association. Of the studies examining dietary outcomes that were considered to have a low risk of bias, the majority (6 out of 7) found improvements in dietary outcomes. All three studies examining food insecurity had a low risk of bias. </p><p>Among studies examining diet quality in the United States, four studies examined universal free breakfasts and one examined CEP. Crepinsek and colleagues examined a national sample of elementary schools participating in universal free breakfast versus matched control schools offering traditional (means-tested) breakfasts [<xref rid="B66-nutrients-13-00911" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>]. This study found that universal free breakfast was positively associated with the consumption of a nutritionally substantive breakfast, including more servings of fruit and dairy. However, there was no association with breakfast skipping or overall dietary intakes over a 24-h period. Similarly, a government report examining the pilot implementation of universal free school breakfasts in six states found no association with nutrients consumed over the course of a day, but students with universal free breakfast were more likely to eat breakfast on all five school days (<italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.01) [<xref rid="B50-nutrients-13-00911" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. A study by Dykstra et al. using a national sample of schools also found that when universal free breakfast was provided, rates of breakfast skipping remained comparable between food-secure and food-insecure students [<xref rid="B54-nutrients-13-00911" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. A study in Boston conducted by Kleinman examined the diets of students and found that those with improved nutrient intakes had significant increases in SBP participation [<xref rid="B67-nutrients-13-00911" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>]. However, this was not observed among all students receiving school breakfasts (i.e., higher SBP participation was observed among the subsample of students with improved diets, but not all SBP participants had observed improvements in their diets). One cross-sectional study without a comparison group examining universal free school meals in six CEP elementary schools in Virginia found that participation in school meals was associated with consumption levels within recommendations by the Dietary Guidelines for Americans, with students consuming roughly 2.5% out of the recommended limit of 10% of daily calories for added sugars (although consumption was not compared with rates prior to implementing CEP) [<xref rid="B68-nutrients-13-00911" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>].</p><p>Two studies examining food insecurity in the U.S. found that CEP was associated with improvements in food security. Poblacion and colleagues used simulation modeling with national data and estimated that CEP would lead to a 3.73% increase in students becoming food secure and a 3.17% increase in food security among previously food-insecure households with children [<xref rid="B69-nutrients-13-00911" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>]. Similarly, a study by Gross et al. conducted in Maryland found that when compared with students at CEP schools, students attending schools in another district that opted not to participate in CEP had increased odds of being in a household that was food insecure (OR 2.85, 95% CI 1.67, 4.88) [<xref rid="B19-nutrients-13-00911" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>].</p><p>When examining just universal free breakfast, a study conducted in Norway among 10th grade students found that free breakfast was associated with overall higher Healthy Eating Index (HEI) scores among male students, but no significant change was observed among female students (and this study was considered to have a very high risk of bias) [<xref rid="B70-nutrients-13-00911" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>]. Additionally, two studies in Wales examined the same dataset with slightly different analyses, and both found that free school breakfasts were associated with an increase in the number of healthy items eaten at breakfast [<xref rid="B71-nutrients-13-00911" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>,<xref rid="B72-nutrients-13-00911" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>], with larger increases observed in lower-income schools [<xref rid="B72-nutrients-13-00911" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>]. Overall, there was no association between free breakfasts and breakfast skipping [<xref rid="B71-nutrients-13-00911" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>], but in sub-analyses, free breakfast was inversely associated with breakfast skipping among students from lower-income households and among students at schools serving higher proportions of students with household poverty [<xref rid="B72-nutrients-13-00911" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>]. Examining 24-h recalls among a subsample of the students participating in the Welsh study, researchers found that among children receiving a free school breakfast, nearly half also had a breakfast at home prior to coming to school, but this was not associated with significant differences in calories consumed over a 24-h period [<xref rid="B73-nutrients-13-00911" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>].</p><p>When examining school lunch initiatives in Norway, a country where nutrition standards are voluntary, studies measuring students&#x02019; diets were mixed. One study by Ask et al. examining 9th grade students participating in a pilot free lunch intervention for four months found no association with healthy food scores (although this study was considered to have a very high risk of bias) [<xref rid="B74-nutrients-13-00911" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>]. A study by Ill&#x000f8;Kken et al. assessed students ages 10&#x02013;12 in an intervention school offering free school lunch (compared with a control group comprised of students at the same school and an additional control school) and found that free school lunch was positively associated with healthy food scores after six months of exposure, primarily due to increased consumption of fruits, vegetables, and fish spread [<xref rid="B75-nutrients-13-00911" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>]. In a separate report of results after following the same students for a year, Vik et al. found that healthy food scores remained significantly higher in the intervention group compared with the control group [<xref rid="B76-nutrients-13-00911" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>], but there were no significant changes in overall meal frequency (e.g., frequency of eating breakfast, lunch, or dinner on weekdays) [<xref rid="B77-nutrients-13-00911" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>].</p><p>Results were similarly mixed among studies conducted in England. One study conducted by Spence et al. examining UIFSM in two primary schools found that free school lunches had lower consumption of non-milk extrinsic sugar (i.e., added sugar) and biscuits (i.e., shortbread cookies) at lunch, but higher intake of cakes/sweet puddings (i.e., desserts), which were offered daily with school lunches after the main meal was served [<xref rid="B78-nutrients-13-00911" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>]. The reductions in added sugar were also observed among the students&#x02019; overall diets (i.e., over the course of an entire day). Another government report by Kitchen and colleagues examining UIFSM found no association with student diets [<xref rid="B61-nutrients-13-00911" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>], and a third conducted by Gatenby and associates examining a free lunch scheme similarly found no association with overall nutrients consumed throughout the day (although this study was deemed to have a very high risk of bias). Notably, students who received school lunches consumed less at lunch than students who brought their lunches from home, but then compensated by eating more foods outside of the lunch period [<xref rid="B79-nutrients-13-00911" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>].</p><p>In other countries, studies examining school meal programs have generally found positive results concerning dietary quality. One study in Japan examining the mandatory school lunches served in elementary and junior high schools found that consuming school lunches was positively associated with total diet quality [<xref rid="B34-nutrients-13-00911" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Additionally, a study conducted in the greater Tokyo area among children ages 6&#x02013;12 found that providing universal (mandatory) school lunches was associated with a reduction in SES-related dietary disparities, particularly regarding fruit and vegetable consumption [<xref rid="B80-nutrients-13-00911" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>]. A smaller study conducted in one kindergarten class in New Zealand found that offering free lunches to all students in the class was associated with significant reductions in snack food consumption while at school (although this study was assessed to have a very high risk of bias) [<xref rid="B81-nutrients-13-00911" ref-type="bibr">81</xref>]. In the OPUS School Meal study, which provided free lunches to all 3rd and 4th grade students in nine schools in Demark for three months (and the students ate packed lunches from home for three months) found significant improvements in students&#x02019; diets, including 16% higher vegetable intakes (<italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.0001) and 48% higher fish intakes (<italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.0001), as well as 30% lower intakes of saturated fats (<italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.0001) [<xref rid="B82-nutrients-13-00911" ref-type="bibr">82</xref>]. Lastly, a similar study conducted in Denmark among four schools that provided free school lunches for two months (compared with control schools with lunches packed from home only) also found that free meals were associated with improved dietary quality, including reductions in saturated fat and snacks and increases in vegetables and fish [<xref rid="B83-nutrients-13-00911" ref-type="bibr">83</xref>]. When the school meals were no longer provided at no cost after the two-month period, participation in school lunch became limited and there were no longer improvements in dietary quality observed.</p><p>One study in New Zealand examined universal free breakfast and food insecurity. Mhurchu et al. conducted a study in 14 primary schools in New Zealand with universal free breakfast and found a significant decrease in children&#x02019;s self-reported short-term hunger, but no association with overall food insecurity levels [<xref rid="B84-nutrients-13-00911" ref-type="bibr">84</xref>]. In contrast, two studies conducted in Greece (as part of the &#x02018;DIATROFI&#x02019; program) with universal free lunches found significant reductions in food insecurity, with the greatest decreases among food-insecure households with hunger [<xref rid="B85-nutrients-13-00911" ref-type="bibr">85</xref>,<xref rid="B86-nutrients-13-00911" ref-type="bibr">86</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec3dot3-nutrients-13-00911"><title>3.3. Attendance</title><p>Researchers have theorized that universal free school meals could increase students&#x02019; school attendance rates through two mechanisms. The first explanation is that students from low-income households may be motivated to attend school to access the food available. Secondly, improved nutrition from school meals may also decrease the incidence of illness, which could improve attendance. Of the seven peer-reviewed publications and two government reports conducted in the U.S. that examined attendance (<italic>n</italic> = 9 studies [<xref rid="nutrients-13-00911-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>]), five found a positive association between universal free school meals and attendance (primarily among sub-populations) and four found no association. A limited number of studies (<italic>n</italic> = 3 peer-reviewed publications) have been conducted in other OECD countries, which included Denmark and New Zealand; none found an association with overall attendance and one found a positive association among students with higher school breakfast participation rates in sub-analyses (<xref rid="nutrients-13-00911-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). Among the studies considered to have a low risk of bias, half (5 out of 10) found positive associations with attendance.</p><p>When examining studies only implementing universal free breakfast, Bartfeld et al. conducted a study in approximately 1000 elementary schools in Wisconsin with varying breakfast models (including universal free and means-tested programs) and found that for lower-income students only, universal free breakfast was associated with an increase in the percent of days attended (0.24 percentage point increase; <italic>p</italic> = 0.023) and a decrease in the percent of students with low attendance (3.5 percentage point decrease; <italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001) [<xref rid="B87-nutrients-13-00911" ref-type="bibr">87</xref>]. Similarly, in the Kleinman et al. study in Boston (<italic>n</italic> = 97 students), improvements in attendance were observed only among the students who improved their nutritional status (which was associated with participation in the SBP) [<xref rid="B67-nutrients-13-00911" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>]. Leos-Urbel and colleagues also observed improvements in attendance among subpopulations within New York City elementary and middle schools; universal free breakfast was associated with a small increase in attendance among low-income Black students and higher-income Asian students [<xref rid="B48-nutrients-13-00911" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. In the study conducted by Ribar et al. in North Carolina among elementary schools that stopped offering universal free breakfasts, no impact on attendance was observed [<xref rid="B49-nutrients-13-00911" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>].

In a government report examining the pilot of universal free breakfast, there was no association with the prevalence of overweight after one year of exposure to free school breakfasts [<xref rid="B50-nutrients-13-00911" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>].</p><p>A study in the Netherlands conducted by Bartelink et al. found that providing children ages 4&#x02013;12 with a free lunch (in additional to some structured physical activity after lunch) was inversely associated with BMI z-score after two years of follow-up (standardized effect size = &#x02212;0.083, <italic>p =</italic> 0.01) [<xref rid="B98-nutrients-13-00911" ref-type="bibr">98</xref>].

However, 5 out of the 6 peer-reviewed publications and government reports in the U.S. reported that increased food and labor costs were balanced by increased revenues from school meals served through federal reimbursements. Of note, these estimates of the cost of implementation do not include the increase in cost to the U.S. federal government. (<xref rid="nutrients-13-00911-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Additionally, one study in Scotland estimated the overall costs of providing universal free lunches (<xref rid="nutrients-13-00911-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). Among these studies, only one was considered to have a low risk of bias, and this study found positive outcomes for school finances with universal free school meals.</p><p>In the U.S., a study in Texas that examined a school district with Provision 2 found that implementation was associated with a 5% increase in annual revenue (statistical significance was not assessed and the study was assessed to have a very high risk of bias) [<xref rid="B55-nutrients-13-00911" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. Similarly, a government report examining the pilot of universal free school breakfasts found that there was an increase in labor costs, but these were more than offset by the increase in meals served (and thus an increase in federal reimbursements), resulting in an average savings of USD 0.11 per breakfast served for districts [<xref rid="B50-nutrients-13-00911" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. Another government report examining the USDA No-Fee School Meal Pilot Program in three states found that providing universal free school meals was associated with a 33% increase in federal reimbursement overall and reduced administrative costs [<xref rid="B56-nutrients-13-00911" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. In a third government report examining CEP, this provision was associated with increased federal meal reimbursements (increase of 5.6% for NSLP and 1.9% for SBP) [<xref rid="B37-nutrients-13-00911" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Staff also spent significantly less time distributing and processing applications for free and reduced-price meals and/or verifying student eligibility, which resulted in an average savings of 68 min per student annually (translating to a labor-saving cost of approximately USD 29 per student per year). This time savings is partially offset by an average 30 min/student increase in staff time annually to claim reimbursable meals (<italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.01). Overall, this government report found that federal funding via reimbursements per student increased by 13.5% (or USD 5.33 per student annually), resulting in potential net gains for school districts participating in CEP. Similarly, in a study conducted in Vermont, school staff (e.g., principals, food service staff, and business managers) perceptions were measured using an online survey, and roughly half of participants perceived that school finances had improved (52.4%), while only 44% perceived that the school meal program deficit was reduced [<xref rid="B95-nutrients-13-00911" ref-type="bibr">95</xref>]. No objective measurements of school finances were collected in this study. Conversely, a government report examining schools that eliminated reduced-price fees within 5 states found that federal reimbursements for the school meals served only partially offset the program costs with higher participation rates (although this report was deemed to have a very high risk of bias) [<xref rid="B57-nutrients-13-00911" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. In Scotland, a government report examining school meals found that the costs of preparing meals varied (from &#x000a3;1.79 to &#x000a3;4.65 per meal). The cost per meal decreased as the number of meals served increased, likely due in part to economies of scale (e.g., buying in bulk or through contract negotiations) [<xref rid="B62-nutrients-13-00911" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>].</p><table-wrap id="nutrients-13-00911-t001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="pii">nutrients-13-00911-t001_Table 1</object-id><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Characteristics of studies conducted in the United States included in the systematic review.</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="center" valign="middle" style="border-top:solid thin;border-bottom:solid thin" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Author, Year</th><th align="center" valign="middle" style="border-top:solid thin;border-bottom:solid thin" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Location; Participant Characteristics</th><th align="center" valign="middle" style="border-top:solid thin;border-bottom:solid thin" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Study Design</th><th align="center" valign="middle" style="border-top:solid thin;border-bottom:solid thin" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Year(s)</th><th align="center" valign="middle" style="border-top:solid thin;border-bottom:solid thin" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Universal Meal Provision</th><th align="center" valign="middle" style="border-top:solid thin;border-bottom:solid thin" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Outcome Measure(s)</th><th align="center" valign="middle" style="border-top:solid thin;border-bottom:solid thin" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Results</th><th align="center" valign="middle" style="border-top:solid thin;border-bottom:solid thin" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Risk of Bias <sup>2</sup></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="center" valign="middle" style="border-bottom:solid thin" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Adams et al. 2020 [<xref rid="B68-nutrients-13-00911" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>]</td><td align="center" valign="middle" style="border-bottom:solid thin" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Virginia; 6 Title I elementary schools (grades 1&#x02013;5), <italic>n</italic> = 1155 plate waste measurements</td><td align="center" valign="middle" style="border-bottom:solid thin" rowspan="1" colspan="1">CS</td><td align="center" valign="middle" style="border-bottom:solid thin" rowspan="1" colspan="1">2016</td><td align="center" valign="middle" style="border-bottom:solid thin" rowspan="1" colspan="1">CEP</td><td align="left" valign="middle" style="border-bottom:solid thin" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><underline>Diet</underline>: Added sugar consumption at lunch (measured using plate waste determined using digital photography)</td><td align="left" valign="middle" style="border-bottom:solid thin" rowspan="1" colspan="1">In CEP schools, foods selected had on average 11.2 g of added sugar and beverages had on average 11.0 g of added sugar.

Discussion</title><p>To our knowledge, this is the first international systematic review of the literature on universal free school meals. This evidence-based review examined the impact of universal free school meals on multiple outcomes for children and schools: (a) meal participation, (b) children&#x02019;s diet quality and food insecurity, (c) academic performance, (d) attendance, (e) BMI, and (f) school finances. This review found substantial support for a positive association between providing universal free school meals and increased meal participation rates. The current review also found evidence for improvements in diet quality and academic performance when universal free school meal provisions included lunch, whereas the evidence was mixed when only universal free breakfasts were available. Research examining the effect of universal free meals on student attendance was mixed; some studies found that overall attendance improved, while others documented significant improvements specifically among higher-risk populations (e.g., lower-income and/or food insecure). The limited studies examining food security also suggested that universal free school meal provisions were associated with improved food security. Nearly all studies found no adverse associations with BMI. The research examining school finances also suggested that schools in the U.S. with a high percentage of students from low-income households may benefit financially from CEP. Overall, the preponderance of the evidence associates positive outcomes with universal free school meals, particularly provisions that include lunch. These findings outweigh the few studies that raised concerns about possible adverse outcomes.</p><p>This literature review found that providing universal free school meals was consistently associated with significant increases in school meal participation. Although increases were generally observed among students previously eligible for free meals [<xref rid="B39-nutrients-13-00911" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>,<xref rid="B48-nutrients-13-00911" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>,<xref rid="B52-nutrients-13-00911" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>,<xref rid="B57-nutrients-13-00911" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>,<xref rid="B61-nutrients-13-00911" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>], the largest increases in participation were observed among students not previously eligible for free or reduced-price school meals [<xref rid="B39-nutrients-13-00911" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>,<xref rid="B48-nutrients-13-00911" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>,<xref rid="B52-nutrients-13-00911" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>,<xref rid="B58-nutrients-13-00911" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>,<xref rid="B60-nutrients-13-00911" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>,<xref rid="B61-nutrients-13-00911" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. This pattern likely reflects the fact that participation rates are usually lower among students who do not qualify for free or reduced-price school meals, thus providing a greater opportunity for an increase. These findings have several important implications for students. First, the increases in participation among students who were previously eligible for free meals but were not participating suggests that policies to provide universal free school meals may reduce stigma associated with receiving school meals, which can result in more low-income children receiving healthy meals and further reducing food insecurity among a vulnerable population. Prior research has also indicated that universal free school meal policies may be successful by reducing stigma [<xref rid="B22-nutrients-13-00911" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="B99-nutrients-13-00911" ref-type="bibr">99</xref>,<xref rid="B100-nutrients-13-00911" ref-type="bibr">100</xref>]. Additionally, when universal free school meals are provided, they reach students who may have been eligible based on income but not enrolled for free/reduced price meals. Failure to sign up for free or reduced-price meals may occur due to social stigma, a lack of information, or challenges with enrolling. Universal free meals also reach students who come from households with food insecurity, but which are not eligible for reduced-priced meals due to family incomes slightly above the eligibility threshold (185% of the federal poverty level) [<xref rid="B88-nutrients-13-00911" ref-type="bibr">88</xref>,<xref rid="B101-nutrients-13-00911" ref-type="bibr">101</xref>,<xref rid="B102-nutrients-13-00911" ref-type="bibr">102</xref>,<xref rid="B103-nutrients-13-00911" ref-type="bibr">103</xref>].</p><p>Among the studies examining universal free school lunches (with or without breakfast), positive associations were generally observed with students&#x02019; diet quality and academic performance, particularly in the presence of strong nutrition standards that include fruits, vegetables, and/or whole grains. These findings highlight the importance of healthy meal guidelines for schools. Additionally, a government report examining universal free school meals noted that due to the reduction in time spent processing applications for free and reduced-price meals, cafeteria staff time was redirected to improving meal quality, nutrition education, and staff development, which can further the positive influence on students&#x02019; dietary behaviors [<xref rid="B56-nutrients-13-00911" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. The limited research examining food security was encouraging, but more high-quality studies are needed to examine if universal free school meals improve food security among students and families. Research has also found that universal free school meals is associated with reductions in students&#x02019; behavioral incidents (e.g., fights) and suspensions, which can interfere with academic performance [<xref rid="B38-nutrients-13-00911" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>,<xref rid="B104-nutrients-13-00911" ref-type="bibr">104</xref>,<xref rid="B105-nutrients-13-00911" ref-type="bibr">105</xref>]. Accordingly, investing in universal free school meal programs may have a profound impact on children&#x02019;s overall health and wellbeing.</p><p>In several domains, the results were consistently positive when examining provisions that included universal free lunches, but were mixed when examining schools that only provided universal free breakfasts. The lack of changes observed with universal free breakfast alone may be in part due to the generally low breakfast participation rates observed, despite being universally free. Emerging research examining breakfast in the classroom models suggests that this method of implementing free breakfasts may substantially increase its reach to children [<xref rid="B106-nutrients-13-00911" ref-type="bibr">106</xref>,<xref rid="B107-nutrients-13-00911" ref-type="bibr">107</xref>,<xref rid="B108-nutrients-13-00911" ref-type="bibr">108</xref>]. Future research should examine whether there are additional benefits when children have access to both universal free breakfast in the classroom and universal free lunches. </p><p>While research examining the association between universal free school meals and attendance was mixed, this might partially be explained by the short exposure to universal free school meals in several of the studies. For example, Bartfeld et al. found that no associations with attendance during the first year of implementing CEP, but low attendance rates were significantly reduced after two years of exposure [<xref rid="B89-nutrients-13-00911" ref-type="bibr">89</xref>]. This may also partially explain why no significant associations were observed among the studies conducted outside of the U.S., which had exposures to free school meals of &#x02264;10 months. Additionally, several studies found that the improvements were only observed among subpopulations, particularly lower-income and/or food insecure students [<xref rid="B48-nutrients-13-00911" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>,<xref rid="B67-nutrients-13-00911" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>,<xref rid="B89-nutrients-13-00911" ref-type="bibr">89</xref>]. This may have important implications for reducing socioeconomic disparities and more long-term studies are warranted. </p><p>Despite concerns about the impact of universal free school meals on BMI, nearly all the studies (6 out of 7) examining BMI found no detrimental impact in terms of increased prevalence of obesity, and in fact, several found a potential reduction in obesity risk associated with universal free meals. This corresponds with several other working papers examining universal free school meals in both U.S. and other OECD countries (i.e., England and Sweden), as well as with peer-reviewed studies examining breakfast in the classroom initiatives and participation in school meal programs more broadly (i.e., means-tested), which have found inverse or no associations with BMI [<xref rid="B96-nutrients-13-00911" ref-type="bibr">96</xref>,<xref rid="B106-nutrients-13-00911" ref-type="bibr">106</xref>,<xref rid="B109-nutrients-13-00911" ref-type="bibr">109</xref>,<xref rid="B110-nutrients-13-00911" ref-type="bibr">110</xref>,<xref rid="B111-nutrients-13-00911" ref-type="bibr">111</xref>,<xref rid="B112-nutrients-13-00911" ref-type="bibr">112</xref>]. For example, Holford and Rabe at the Institute for Social and Economic Research examined UIFSM and found that children receiving free school lunches for a year were 1.2% more likely to be a healthy weight and 0.7% less likely to be obese [<xref rid="B111-nutrients-13-00911" ref-type="bibr">111</xref>]. Overall, research examining universal free school meals and BMI suggests that in the presence of strong meal standards, providing universal free school meals to students appears to have no adverse impacts on weight and in fact, may reduce the risk of obesity among some populations, although more peer-reviewed research in the U.S. and other countries is warranted. </p><p>School finances were also examined in a limited number of studies, primarily in the U.S. While these studies generally found that school food service budgets may have benefitted from CEP, selection bias may have been an issue. The federal reimbursement rate corresponds to the percentage of students categorically eligible for free meals (the &#x0201c;identified student percentage&#x0201d; [ISP]); therefore, ISP is highly correlated with school/district participation in CEP because schools with a high ISP are more likely to participate and will also have higher federal reimbursement rates [<xref rid="B113-nutrients-13-00911" ref-type="bibr">113</xref>]. For example, with the current federal reimbursement calculation (which multiplies the ISP by 1.6 to calculate the percentage of meals that will be reimbursed at the rate for free meals), a school with a 40% ISP would receive federal reimbursement that would only cover 64% of all the meals served. Schools actually need an ISP of &#x02265;62.5% in order to be fully reimbursed by the federal government for school meals served with CEP. A policy change to cease the use of ISP and instead fully reimburse schools for all meals served using a national universal free school meal schema would alleviate concerns regarding financial losses to schools. Two additional challenges to school food service finances are that the price charged for full-price meals does not always cover the full cost of the school meal, and that some families fail to pay for the full or reduced-price meals received by their children, resulting in school meal debt. Universal free school meals can help address these issues by shifting the burden of covering school meal costs away from schools and families. In England, the UIFSM was estimated to cost &#x000a3;400 per student annually (roughly USD 550/student) [<xref rid="B114-nutrients-13-00911" ref-type="bibr">114</xref>]. However, prior research has suggested that universal free school meals may have a positive impact on household finances, particularly among lower income families (many of whom are still above the threshold to qualify for free or reduced-price meals) [<xref rid="B115-nutrients-13-00911" ref-type="bibr">115</xref>,<xref rid="B116-nutrients-13-00911" ref-type="bibr">116</xref>]. One study in UK that conducted financial modeling analyses found that families who were in the second and third lowest deciles of income (who were not already eligible for free school meals) benefited the most from universal free school meals [<xref rid="B115-nutrients-13-00911" ref-type="bibr">115</xref>]. Reducing food insecurity through universal free meals may also help alleviate its concomitant societal costs. For example, in the U.S., food insecurity has been estimated to be associated with over USD 1.2 billion in costs to the health care and education systems [<xref rid="B117-nutrients-13-00911" ref-type="bibr">117</xref>]. Overall, more research examining the total cost of universal free school meals at the national level is warranted, and this research should account for potential direct and indirect benefits of universal free school meals that may have both short and long-term economic benefits.</p><p>Several studies examined differences in outcomes related to universal free school meals by student socio-economic status. Interestingly, many studies found that not only did universal free school meals tend to be associated with positive outcomes among lower-income students&#x02500; the population that is typically targeted by free school meal programs&#x02500; but higher-income students frequently benefitted as well. For example, higher school meal participation rates were observed among children from both higher and lower-income households in the majority of included studies, and multiple studies found that attendance improved among both lower-income and higher-income populations [<xref rid="B48-nutrients-13-00911" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>,<xref rid="B87-nutrients-13-00911" ref-type="bibr">87</xref>,<xref rid="B89-nutrients-13-00911" ref-type="bibr">89</xref>]. Similarly, two studies found positive associations with academic performance among both lower and higher income students and one found a reduced probability of obesity among higher income students [<xref rid="B39-nutrients-13-00911" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>,<xref rid="B87-nutrients-13-00911" ref-type="bibr">87</xref>]. Prior research has also documented improvements in students&#x02019; diets after implementation of stronger school meal standards, including among both lower and higher-income students [<xref rid="B25-nutrients-13-00911" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="B64-nutrients-13-00911" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>,<xref rid="B118-nutrients-13-00911" ref-type="bibr">118</xref>]. This may be in part because many students who are just above eligibility cutoffs (and do not qualify for free or reduced-price meals) also experience food insecurity and therefore may benefit from universal free school meals [<xref rid="B119-nutrients-13-00911" ref-type="bibr">119</xref>]. Overall, this suggests that universal free school meals may benefit socio-economically diverse student populations and countries that currently limit free school meals to lower-income school districts may want to consider broader policies. </p><p>This study has several limitations. First, the assessment of outcomes varied from one study to another, especially regarding the evaluations of children&#x02019;s&#x02019; diets. For example, while some studies used 24-h recalls, others used food frequency questionnaires or food insecurity questionnaires, and dietary assessments also varied in who completed them (e.g., student self-report or parent-report). While these methods have typically been validated, due to the heterogeneity in outcome measures, a meta-analysis was not possible. The risk of bias also varied from very high to low based on NOS scores, and the results of this review must be interpreted accordingly. However, when examining only the studies with a low risk of bias, the conclusions remained unchanged. Publication bias (i.e., studies with non-significant results are less likely to be published) may have also been an issue, although multiple studies included in the review found no significant associations. The studies reviewed were also conducted in economically developed countries; therefore, future systematic reviews should examine economically less-developed countries, especially as these results suggest that the most vulnerable populations (e.g., food insecure) incur the most benefit from universal free school meals. Lastly, while some studies were randomized, many of relied on natural experiments and therefore schools (and students) were not randomly assigned to receive free meals. However, natural experiments may have better external generalizability due to their implementation in real-world settings. Countries that are considering expanded universal free school meal programs could facilitate evaluations in diverse schools (including those that vary by student SES) through first enabling rigorous designs such as randomized trials before implementation on a wider scale. Such a phased roll-out would enable a fuller understanding of the impact of universal school meals on diverse student populations and school finances. This systematic review was further strengthened by the large number of studies included.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec5-nutrients-13-00911"><title>5. Conclusions</title><p>Overall, this review suggests that universal free school meals benefit students, particularly those who are food-insecure and/or near eligible for free meals in existing means-tested school meal models. The majority of studies in the current review found that universal free school meals were associated with increases in participation and improved diet quality and food security, and conversely, were associated with either no change or improved BMI. Further research is needed regarding the implementation of universal free meal programs and the ways in which optimal participation and benefits can be achieved through such policy changes. In the presence of strong nutrition guidelines, universal free school meals have multiple potential benefits for students and schools, and should be considered by countries not currently with this policy.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>The authors would like to thank the Healthy Eating Research staff at Duke University for their support.</p></ack><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Publisher&#x02019;s Note:</bold> MDPI stays neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.</p></fn></fn-group><app-group><app id="app1-nutrients-13-00911"><title>Supplementary Materials</title><p>The following are available online at <uri xlink:href="https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/13/3/911/s1">https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/13/3/911/s1</uri>.
