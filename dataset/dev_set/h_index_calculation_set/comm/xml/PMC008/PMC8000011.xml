Raw oil palm empty fruit bunch (OPEFB) was subjected to chemical treatment and acid hydrolysis to obtain C filler. B filler was ultra-sonicated for better dispersion in the TPS films to improve the filler&#x02013;matrix interactions. The morphology and structure of fillers were characterized by scanning electron microscope (SEM), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and X-ray diffraction (XRD). TPS hybrid bio-composite films were produced by the casting method with different ratios of B and C fillers. The best ratio of B/C was determined through the data of the tensile test. FTIR analysis proved the molecular interactions between the TPS and the hybrid fillers due to the presence of polar groups in their structure. XRD analysis confirmed the intercalation of the TPS chains between the B inter-platelets as a result of well-developed interactions between the TPS and hybrid fillers. SEM images suggested that more plastic deformation occurred in the fractured surface of the TPS hybrid bio-composite film due to the higher degree of stretching after being subjected to tensile loading. Overall, the results indicate that incorporating the hybrid B/C fillers could tremendously improve the mechanical properties of the films. The best ratio of B/C in the TPS was found to be 4:1, in which the tensile strength (8.52MPa), Young&#x02019;s modulus (42.0 MPa), elongation at break (116.4%) and tensile toughness of the film were increased by 92%, 146%, 156% and 338%, respectively. The significantly improved strength, modulus, flexibility and toughness of the film indicate the benefits of using the hybrid fillers, since these features are useful for the development of sustainable flexible packaging film. </p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>oil palm empty fruit bunch (OPEFB)</kwd><kwd>microcrystalline cellulose</kwd><kwd>nano-bentonite</kwd><kwd>bio-composites</kwd><kwd>tensile properties</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec1-polymers-13-00897"><title>1. Introduction</title><p>Conventional plastics bring so much convenience to our life. We consume plastics in our day-to-day life and in many applications, including food packaging and drinking straws [<xref rid="B1-polymers-13-00897" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Conventional plastic or fossil-fuel plastic has many unique characteristics that make it one of the most essential materials in manufacturing a product, such as having a wide range of processing temperatures, high chemical resistance, a high strength to weight ratio, ease of processing and low costs [<xref rid="B2-polymers-13-00897" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. These properties indicate the versatility of plastic materials, and therefore they are being used to substitute other materials such as metal and ceramic in certain applications. Unfortunately, plastic&#x02019;s great properties are sometimes overshadowed by its non-degradable properties which cause disposal problems and pollution on earth [<xref rid="B3-polymers-13-00897" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Nowadays, the plastic disposal problem is getting more severe. Thus, researchers are focusing on producing bio-plastics from natural sources such as starch which can be obtained from rice, corn, potato, and pea to solve the problem highlighted above.</p><p>Among all the biopolymers, starch has drawn significant attention from the researchers owing to its unique characteristics. Starch can be processed using the same processing techniques as conventional plastic, such as injection, extrusion and thermoforming. Starch is biodegradable and can be plasticized into a more useful form of plastic, which is called thermoplastic starch (TPS) [<xref rid="B4-polymers-13-00897" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. However, to compete with conventional plastic, TPS-based plastics should possess comparable mechanical properties and barrier properties to conventional plastic. Yet, this is very difficult to achieve since thermoplastic starch inherited hydrophilic properties; thus, it has high sensitivity toward moisture absorption from the surroundings. The mechanical properties of thermoplastic starch decrease exponentially with the increase in humidity [<xref rid="B5-polymers-13-00897" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. In order to improve the mechanical and barrier properties of thermoplastic starch, inorganic fillers or organic fillers are added to thermoplastic starch to increase its mechanical strength and barrier properties [<xref rid="B6-polymers-13-00897" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>].</p><p>Palm oil is considered as one of the most important edible oils in the world, next only to soybean. However, palm oil extraction will generate an enormous amount of palm oil biomass wastes that consume up a large landfill area and endangering the environment [<xref rid="B6-polymers-13-00897" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Oil palm empty fruit bunch (OPEFB), as one of the major palm oil biomass wastes, contains a high percentage of cellulose of about 40&#x02013;60%, which is the highest compared to kenaf, corn, and bagasse fiber [<xref rid="B7-polymers-13-00897" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Therefore, extraction of microcrystalline cellulose from the OPEFB is one of the effective strategies to add value the waste material.</p><p>In the search of new fillers for TPS that capable of enhancing its properties for various applications, the idea of using hybrid fillers (more than one type of filler) arrived due to the demands of consumers for biodegradable plastic packaging with combination of strength and toughness properties. The use of hybrid fillers may allow more comprehensive improvement in the properties of the TPS film by providing synergistic effect through the combination of both filler&#x02019;s properties [<xref rid="B8-polymers-13-00897" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>].</p><p>In this study, we have investigated the efficiency of using hybrid nano-bentonite (in-organic nano-clay) and OPEFB derived microcrystalline cellulose (organic fiber) fillers in improving the mechanical properties of the TPS bio-composite plastic film, particularly its tensile strength and flexibility (toughness). The microcrystalline cellulose and ultra-sonicated nano-bentonite were expected to have good interaction with the TPS due to their hydrophilic properties, thus enhancement in the TPS film&#x02019;s mechanical properties could be gained. However, the TPS bio-composite film&#x02019;s optimal strength can only be achieved when the nano-bentonite and microcrystalline cellulose are well dispersed in the matrix of the biopolymer. Nonetheless, nano-bentonite particles always tend to agglomerate when dispersed in the polymer matrix. To encounter this, ultra-sonication treatment is applied to improve dispersion of the nano-clay filler in a polymer matrix [<xref rid="B6-polymers-13-00897" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>].</p><p>Tensile toughness property of a material relates to its capability to possess both high tensile strength and high flexibility when stretched. So far, there have been no published papers reporting an increase in both the strength and toughness of the bio-polymeric film with the addition of fillers; in fact, most articles report a decrease in the flexibility of the film along with the increase in its strength [<xref rid="B9-polymers-13-00897" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="B10-polymers-13-00897" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="B11-polymers-13-00897" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="B12-polymers-13-00897" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="B13-polymers-13-00897" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="B14-polymers-13-00897" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. This is because high-modulus filler can restrict the molecular motions of the biopolymer matrices, lowering its elongation at break value and thus making it more brittle. Unfortunately, this characteristic is not suitable for flexible film packaging applications because the ability to stretch without breaking (tough) is a key requirement of such a film. Therefore, there is the need to discover new hybrid fillers that are capable of improving the toughness property of the bio-composite film by elevating both tensile strength and elongation at break values of the material. In this work, we have proved that enhancement in both tensile strength and elongation at break can be gained with the use of B/C hybrid fillers. As far as the bio-composite with a dual-type filler system (hybrid) is concerned, this discovery is the first to be reported. Furthermore, the dual hybrid filler system which comprised the OPEFB-derived microcrystalline cellulose and nano-bentonite was first to be introduced in the TPS bio-composite system. Both fillers were characterized by scanning electron microscope (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). Bio-composite films with several ratios of B/C filler were produced using the casting technique. A tensile test was employed to determine the TPS bio-composite films&#x02019; mechanical properties containing a different ratio of microcrystalline cellulose and nano-bentonite. The optimal ratio of the OPEFB microcrystalline cellulose/nano-bentonite of the hybrid fillers that was capable of providing the best reinforcing and toughening effects to the TPS bio-composite film was determined. </p></sec><sec id="sec2-polymers-13-00897"><title>2.

Apparently, there are changes in the OPEFB morphology detected through the comparison of both micrographs indicating the success of the chemical pre-treatment procedure in removing non-cellulosic materials such as hemicellulose, lignin and waxy substances from the raw OPEFB fiber.</p><p>The raw OPEFB fiber in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="polymers-13-00897-f001">Figure 1</xref>a possesses an irregular shape and the surface of the microfibrils cellulose (pointed by the blue arrow) was covered up by non-cellulosic materials which act as the protective surface (as marked by red circles). In contrast, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="polymers-13-00897-f001">Figure 1</xref>b shows the smooth, clear and individualized rod-like microfibrils surface of cellulose.

It can be observed that the structure of the OPEFB cellulose&#x02019;s microfibril was completely destroyed and the size of the cellulose was significantly being reduced. However, the SEM diagram suggests that the microcrystalline cellulose tends to aggregate together into large particles of cellulose. Agglomeration of cellulose usually occurs after being dried from the suspension form [<xref rid="B15-polymers-13-00897" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>].</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="polymers-13-00897-f002">Figure 2</xref>a,b display the SEM images of the pristine nano-bentonite and ultra-sonicated bentonite, respectively. By comparing both figures, we can prove that the particle size of the nano-bentonite had been reduced significantly upon the ultra-sonication process. Before ultra-sonication, the nano-bentonite appears in large particles with an irregular shape and size. This was due to the high stacking of platelets forming large tactoids of the phyllo-silicate structure. After being ultra-sonicated, the particle size of the nano-bentonite was seen to greatly reduce, with rougher surface morphology. This observation was due to the tactoid size reduction of the nano-clay as a result of the delamination of the nano-platelets. However, in agglomerated form, it is difficult to get a clear image of the individual platelet of the nano-bentonite and determine its particle size. However, the results can confirm that the ultra-sonication process has successfully reduced the tactoid size of the nano-bentonite.</p></sec><sec id="sec3dot2-polymers-13-00897"><title>3.2.

The CrI was calculated based on the Segal formula [<xref rid="B26-polymers-13-00897" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. The raw OPEFB possesses 37.80% CrI value, which is the lowest among all samples. This can be associated with its high amorphous region. Conversely, the microcrystalline cellulose possesses the highest CrI value, which is 65.9% due to the removal of the amorphous phase from its structure.</p><p>The low Crl value of the raw OPEFB indicates that it contains a high content of hemicellulose and lignin.

As expected, crystallinity of the OPEFB increased after the removal of lignin and hemicellulose. After the alkaline and bleaching pre-treatment, the peak of the treated OPEFB cellulose became sharper and more intense than the raw OPEFB, suggesting that the crystallinity of the treated OPEFB cellulose becomes higher after the treatment. However, the CrI value has been further increased when the treated OPEFB cellulose was acid hydrolyzed to form microcrystalline cellulose.

However, the signal from 5&#x000b0; to 10&#x000b0; was focused to clearly observe the changes in d<sub>001</sub> basal spacing of the nano-bentonite upon ultra-sonication (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="polymers-13-00897-f006">Figure 6</xref>b).

However, the d<sub>001</sub> of the nano-bentonite has been increased to 1.47 nm after the ultra-sonication process. This indicates that the ultra-sonication process does slightly increase the d<sub>001</sub> of the nano-bentonite, by altering the bentonite layer&#x02019;s stacking through de-agglomeration of the bentonite&#x02019;s tactoids. The small increase in the basal spacing of bentonite can facilitate the intercalation of the TPS chain during the mixing process and improve the film&#x02019;s strength. This outcome was the same with the result of Abdul Hamid et al., where they showed that the ultra-sonication process could produce more loosely packed MMT and encourage the copolymer chains&#x02019; intercalation inter-platelets [<xref rid="B29-polymers-13-00897" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>].</p><p>Apparently, there are clear changes in the XRD pattern of the nano-bentonite after it is subjected to the ultra-sonication process (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="polymers-13-00897-f006">Figure 6</xref>a).

Mechanical Analysis of TPS, TPS/B and TPS/C Bio-Composites, TPS/B/C Hybrid Bio-Composite Films</title><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="polymers-13-00897-f007">Figure 7</xref>a shows the tensile strength of the TPS and TPS bio-composite film with different nano-bentonite (B) and microcrystalline cellulose (C) ratios. Regardless of the types of filler used (single or hybrid), the tensile strength value of the film increased with the incorporation of 5 wt% fillers into the TPS matrix. These results were in accordance with many reviews where phyllosilicate clay and cellulose can improve the TPS composite films&#x02019; tensile strength due to high compatibility and positive interactions such as hydrogen bonding between the TPS matrix and nanofiller, leading to better stress transfer [<xref rid="B31-polymers-13-00897" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="B32-polymers-13-00897" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. The unfilled TPS exhibits the lowest tensile strength, which is 4.44 MPa, while the TPS/4B1C hybrid bio-composite film possesses the highest tensile strength (8.52 MPa), showing 92% increment when benchmarked with the unfilled TPS. This signifies that the inclusion of the hybrid B/C fillers at the optimum ratio can bring a positive synergy effect within the TPS matrix and enhance the tensile strength of the film with a more efficient load transfer mechanism. This explanation was in line with the results of Zakuwan et al., in which tensile strength improvement was obtained when cellulose nanocrystal and modified MMT was incorporated into the biopolymer. They claimed that the network forming of nanocellulose and MMT enforcement in a different dimension in the biopolymer matrix can improve bio-composite films&#x02019; reinforcement capability [<xref rid="B33-polymers-13-00897" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>].</p><p>The results also suggest that the use of single filler (either C alone or B alone) could not allow the film to achieve higher tensile strength than the hybrid fillers 4B1C. However, the use of C resulted in a higher increment in tensile strength as compared to B. As compared to C, B tends to experience a higher degree of agglomeration in the biopolymer matrix due to its platy particles that are easily stacked together to form tactoids. Poor dispersion of tactoids reduces the efficiency of the B filler in reinforcing the matrix. C can better reinforce the TPS due to its fibrous-like particles that can transfer the load more efficiently [<xref rid="B34-polymers-13-00897" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. However, when used as hybrid filler with the B, C cannot be added in more than 1 wt%. We have postulated that the high content of C in the hybrid filler system can reduce the reinforcing effect because overcrowding of the C particles may occur and inhibit good dispersion and distribution of the B&#x02019;s nanoplatelets in the matrix. Poorly dispersed hybrid fillers may form a stress concentration point in the TPS matrix and reduce the tensile properties of the TPS [<xref rid="B35-polymers-13-00897" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>,<xref rid="B36-polymers-13-00897" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>].</p><p>The Young&#x02019;s modulus values of the TPS, TPS bio-composites and TPS hybrid bio-composites with different B and C ratios are compared in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="polymers-13-00897-f007">Figure 7</xref>b. It can be seen that the Young&#x02019;s modulus values of all the TPS bio-composites are higher than the unfilled TPS, showing that incorporating single or hybrid fillers into the TPS may improve the stiffness of the film. The unfilled TPS exhibits the lowest Young&#x02019;s modulus, which is 17.1 MPa, while TPS/4B1C hybrid bio-composite demonstrates the highest Young&#x02019;s modulus, which is 42.0 MPa. However, the Young&#x02019;s modulus of the film has slightly decreased to 36.22 MPa when the C loading increased to 2 wt% (3B2C). Moreover, the Young&#x02019;s modulus values of the TPS/2B3C and TPS/1B4C films show no significant difference with the TPS/3B2C, indicating that increases in the C loading in the matrix does not further improve the stiffness of the film. Agglomeration of C particles may occur when added in high content, reducing the matrix&#x02013;filler interactions [<xref rid="B37-polymers-13-00897" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. In agreement with the tensile strength data, the Young&#x02019;s modulus of the TPS/5B is lower than the TPS/5C bio-composite film. As mentioned earlier, the platy particles of B can stack together in great numbers, poorly dispersed and distributed in the matrix. This reduces matrix&#x02013;filler interactions that play the main role in stiffening the matrix.</p><p>Based on <xref ref-type="fig" rid="polymers-13-00897-f007">Figure 7</xref>c, the TPS/1B4C hybrid bio-composite film demonstrates the elongation at a break value of 117%, which is 156% higher than the unfilled TPS. This is somewhat impressive as the addition of natural filler or inorganic filler always reduces the elongation at break of the matrix. This is because filler with a stiffer characteristic reduces the flexibility of the biopolymer [<xref rid="B9-polymers-13-00897" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="B10-polymers-13-00897" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="B11-polymers-13-00897" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="B12-polymers-13-00897" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="B13-polymers-13-00897" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="B14-polymers-13-00897" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>].</p><p>Tensile toughness is calculated based on the area under the stress&#x02013;strain curve.

Overall, the results suggest that the film&#x02019;s tensile toughness has been tremendously improved upon incorporation of the hybrid fillers. TPS/4B1C displays the highest value of tensile toughness with an increment of ~338%, when compared with the unfilled TPS. The difference in physical characteristics (size, shape, etc.) and chemistry of B and C fillers might contribute to a greater toughening effect on the film. We are still investigating these factors and perhaps will come out with theory and a mechanism in our next publications after finishing all the analyses. For now, we are postulating that the fibrous particles of C, when dispersed well in the matrix, not only can contribute to good stress transfer mechanism, but will also produce more free volume in the matrix when the film is stretched. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="polymers-13-00897-f009">Figure 9</xref> illustrates the proposed mechanism. During tensile deformation, the small size of B nanoplatelets and the TPS molecular chains will arrange and stretch according to strain direction. This will produce greater interface bonding between the B and the TPS molecular chains, thus producing a more effective stress transferring mechanism. The bigger and longer C particles are not as mobile as the B nanoplatelets and, therefore, will not exactly follow the strain direction, but rather arrange themselves vertically between the stretched TPS molecular chains. This resulted in the formation of more free volumes in the hybrid bio-composite structure, allowing for greater starch chain mobility (entropy) and conformational freedom. The conformation of the TPS chains will stimulate chain relaxation in the stress concentrated area and allow the matrix to be more flexible and more efficient in absorbing energy through molecular motions. These interactions might responsible for contributing to the toughening effect on the film.</p><p>Comparative study was done with other TPS bio-composite systems investigated by other researchers. Based on the data obtained from recent literatures, our TPS hybrid bio-composite film&#x02019;s tensile strength is on par with the values reported, while the flexibility of our film is much better than them [<xref rid="B13-polymers-13-00897" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="B14-polymers-13-00897" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="B39-polymers-13-00897" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. For instance, Fazeli et al. have used cellulose fibers to reinforce the TPS derived from corn. They have applied surface modification on the cellulose fiber using the air plasma treatment to improve the matrix/fiber adhesion in the TPS bio-composite structure. The maximum tensile strength was achieved when the plasma treated cellulose fiber was added in 6 wt%. However, elongation at break value has been dropped significantly from 48.2% to 9.2% only [<xref rid="B13-polymers-13-00897" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. In another work, Chen et al. have prepared TPS bio-composite films containing oxidized microcrystalline cellulose (MCC) as a reinforcing filler via a hot-compression molding technique. As compared to the original MCC, the oxidized MCC was more capable of enhancing the tensile strength of the TPS. However, the tensile strength obtained was 6.61 MPa while the elongation at break was only 40% [<xref rid="B14-polymers-13-00897" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. In more recent work, Yin et al. have prepared the TPS bio-composites filled with dialdehyde lignocellulose (DLC) in the loading of 0 to 12 wt%. Maximum tensile strength was obtained when 3 wt% DLC was employed as filler with the value of 5.26 MPa. However, the bio-composite only managed to achieve elongation at a break value of 91.60% [<xref rid="B39-polymers-13-00897" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Both tensile strength and elongation at break values reported for the TPS bio-composites in the above literatures were lower than the values of our optimum hybrid bio-composite system (TPS/1B4C). As mentioned in the above discussion, the maximum tensile strength and elongation at break of the TPS hybrid bio-composite film in this study were 8.52 MPa and 117%, respectively. Apparently, the improvement in toughness value upon the inclusion of the hybrid fillers was impressive (+338%). The work by Li et al. has shown that they have successfully obtained very high tensile strength starch-based bio-composites when using montmorillonite and cellulose nanofiber as hybrid fillers. However, the elongation at break values of the samples was very low (less than 7%) compared to our hybrid TPS bio-composite films (117%). The above findings proved that that the origin of starch, method of processing and types of filler/hybrid fillers used will determine the obtained tensile strength and elongation at break of the bio-composite film. These are in agreement with review papers wrote by P&#x000e9;rez-Pacheco et al. [<xref rid="B11-polymers-13-00897" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] and Xie et al. [<xref rid="B31-polymers-13-00897" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. In our case, the unfilled TPS has shown very moderate tensile strength, but the hybrid B/C fillers have played their role in simultaneously enhancing the tensile strength and elongation at break of the TPS matrix. Thus, significant enhancement in the tensile toughness of the film could be observed. This trend is rarely obtained and reported. Nevertheless, we believe that our films that possess good flexibility and toughness will suit for certain applications such as for short term flexible packaging and wrapping plastic.</p></sec><sec id="sec3dot5-polymers-13-00897"><title>3.5.

For the TPS/5B sample, there is a shift of peak at 3320 cm<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> to a lower wavenumber, which is 3310 cm<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>, indicating new and stable hydrogen bonds formed in the TPS bio-composite films [<xref rid="B44-polymers-13-00897" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>].

Based on the FTIR spectra of TPS/5C, it can be observed that incorporation of C into the TPS matrix has slightly sharpened the peak and also shifted the peak to a lower wavenumber (3315 cm<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>). This can be associated with the O-H vibration of the high crystalline structure of the C filler. This outcome was in accordance with the study of Zhang et al.

For the analysis of the TPS/4B1C hybrid bio-composite film, interactions between the TPS and hybrid fillers can also be realized through the FTIR data.

This indicates that hybrid fillers have good compatibility with the TPS matrix by forming strong polar hydroxyl interactions.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="polymers-13-00897-f011">Figure 11</xref>a shows the XRD pattern of the unfilled TPS, TPS bio-composite and TPS hybrid bio-composite films. TPS has experienced a reduction in peak intensity in the region of 2&#x0019f; = 10&#x02013;40&#x000b0; when added with filler (either single or hybrid fillers) due to the reduction in retrogradation rate that occurs in the matrix. Interface interactions between the matrix and fillers can slow down the retrogradation process of the starch. During the TPS matrix cooling, the amylose and amylopectin chains are starting to arrange back into an ordered structure different from native starch granules. The retrogradation process involved a few steps: extrusion of water, an increase in viscosity, gel formation and forming a crystalline structure. The typical retrogradation peaks of TPS can be seen at 17&#x000b0; and 22.6&#x000b0;.</p><p>The XRD pattern of the TPS/5C film presents the typical peak of retrograded starch structure (type B and type Vh peak) and the signal of the C filler. However, due to the similar chemical structure of TPS and microcrystalline cellulose in the TPS/5C composite, the XRD pattern shows superimposition of both parent components balanced by the composition. This is in line with the study of Dufresne et al. [<xref rid="B37-polymers-13-00897" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Incorporation of C into the TPS has brought a reduction in the intensity of Vh peaks in the XRD spectrum. This was possibly due to the transcrystallization of amylose and amylopectin on the microcrystalline cellulose surface, leading to a reduction of the starch chain&#x02019;s recrystallization. The same observation was reported in the study of Fourati et al. They found that the Vh-type structure of the TPS reduced with the increase in the cellulose nanofiber content [<xref rid="B47-polymers-13-00897" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>].</p><p>It can also be observed that the intensity of the peak related to the Vh-type structure of the TPS is lower in the TPS/4B1C hybrid bio-composite as compared to the unfilled TPS. The Vh-type structure formed in TPS was due to amylose&#x02019;s recrystallization with plasticizer in the helix channel. Reduction in the peak intensity of the Vh type crystalline structure indicates that the retrogradation of the TPS was hindered with the incorporation of the single B filler or hybrid B/C fillers. The anti-retrogradation of the TPS films with the nano-bentonite was due to the hydrophilicity of bentonite clay&#x02019;s surface that increased the interaction between the starch chain and bentonite platelets, affecting the dynamic rearrangement of the starch chain. Consequently, the ability of the TPS chains to recrystallize was reduced. This trend was also reported by Lara et al., where they found that the retrogradation of starch plasticized by water and glycerol was reduced by incorporating MMT [<xref rid="B48-polymers-13-00897" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. Interestingly, the TPS/4B1C hybrid bio-composite film exhibits a smaller and broader peak of the Vh-type structure as compared to the TPS/5B bio-composite. This proved that the use of hybrid filler with a low content of C (1 wt%) may result in greater efficiency in preventing retrogradation than the use of single C or single B filler.</p><p>Next, the XRD signal from 5&#x000b0; to 10&#x000b0; was focused to have a clear comparison on the d<sub>001</sub> basal spacing of the nano-bentonite clay before and after being incorporated into the TPS matrix. As expected, there is no peak that can be observed in the XRD signal of the unfilled TPS and TPS/5C bio-composite in the low-angle region (2&#x0019f; = 5&#x02013;10&#x000b0;) since TPS is amorphous. It is known that the peak that appears at a low angle value between 5&#x02013;10&#x000b0; represents the d<sub>001</sub> basal spacing of bentonite clay [<xref rid="B8-polymers-13-00897" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. When single B filler or hybrid B/C fillers were incorporated into the TPS, the d<sub>001</sub> peak of B had shifted to a lower angle, indicating an increase in the interlayer basal spacing of the clay due to the intercalation of TPS chains and microcrystalline cellulose into the layered silicate structure of bentonite without complete exfoliation.</p><p>The TPS/4B1C hybrid bio-composite film shows the highest increment in basal spacing in which the d<sub>001</sub> increased from 1.47 to 1.55 nm. Moreover, broadening of the d<sub>001</sub> peak can clearly be seen. It seems that the inter-platelets of the nano-bentonite have been well intercalated by the TPS chains with the presence of a small amount of the microcrystalline cellulose. This could be due to the capability of bentonite to interact with the C filler, other than the host biopolymer. As mentioned earlier, there are strong polar interactions between the TPS, C and B fillers due to the hydroxyl group composition within their structure. The interface interactions between B and C help to pull the B platelets away from its tactoid structure, making a wider space for the TPS chains intercalation. This factor explains why the TPS/4B1C performed the greatest mechanical properties compared to other TPS bio-composite films.</p></sec><sec id="sec3dot6-polymers-13-00897"><title>3.6. Fractured Surface Morphology of the TPS Bio-Composite and TPS Hybrid Bio-Composite Films as Observed through Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) Analyses</title><p>The tensile fractured surface morphologies of the TPS, TPS bio-composite and TPS hybrid bio-composite were studied by Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="polymers-13-00897-f012">Figure 12</xref>a shows that the fractured surface of the TPS films was uniform and no residual for the starch granule structure can be observed. The smooth surface indicates that the origin starch granule structure was completely disrupted and broken when starch was plasticized with glycerol and water at a high temperature. The TPS film possesses a smooth surface showing that the unfilled TPS underwent a very low degree of matrix deformation and easily fracture upon the application of a small tensile load/force. Both TPS/5C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="polymers-13-00897-f012">Figure 12</xref>e) and TPS/5B (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="polymers-13-00897-f012">Figure 12</xref>b) also show a clean and smooth fracture surface, indicating that both types of the TPS bio-composites have experienced some degree of matrix deformation upon tensile loading, but not much. For the TPS/5B bio-composite film, no image of B filler could be captured due to the very small size of the nano-bentonite. However, for the TPS/5C bio-composite film, the fractured surface shows some aggregation of C (circle in red color) inside the matrix of the TPS due to the strong intramolecular hydrogen bonding between the particles of C. This filler&#x02013;filler interaction caused aggregation of C in the TPS matrix and prohibited the bio-composite to achieve a higher tensile strength. This was in line with the study of Zhang et al. where the nanocellulose agglomeration phenomenon in the host TPS had caused uneven loading distribution, void formation in the matrix and subsequently led to premature failure [<xref rid="B33-polymers-13-00897" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Small voids were observed due to the agglomerated C fiber pullout from the matrix phase. The C fiber was pulled out in the same direction of the tensile force applied. By adding 1% of C as co-filler with B, the fractured surface morphology of the TPS film has changed drastically. The surface roughness increased due to the occurrence of significant matrix deformation. This tallies with the tensile data which indicate that the elongation at break of this TPS/4B1C film was higher than the unfilled TPS and TPS bio-composite with single filler. However, there is no agglomeration and aggregation of C spotted in the SEM images of the TPS/4B1C, indicating that the C particles have been well dispersed inside the TPS matrix due to the good compatibility and interactions with the matrix and B filler. Furthermore, there is no fiber pullout that can be observed in the surface of the TPS/4B1C bio-composite film. This could be attributed to better interface interaction between C and the matrix with the presence of B. The C fiber was well wetted and embedded in the TPS matrix and led to high contact surface area between C and the TPS. In addition, the appearance of a tiny fibril structure bridging the small voids (blue color circle in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="polymers-13-00897-f012">Figure 12</xref>g,h) was noticed, suggesting that the C filler has been vertically oriented to the force applied during the tensile test. A similar structure of nanocellulose bridging in TPS was also observed by Li et al. [<xref rid="B40-polymers-13-00897" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>].</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec4-polymers-13-00897"><title>4. Conclusions</title><p>Microcrystalline cellulose (C) was extracted from the raw OPEFB fiber and nano-bentonite (B) was ultra-sonicated to reduce the large tactoid structure. The changes in structure and morphology of the fillers from their original form after being subjected to chemical treatment and the ultra-sonication process have been witnessed and confirmed through FTIR, XRD and SEM analyses. Both fillers were used to form hybrid fillers in the production of the TPS hybrid bio-composite film. The TPS bio-composite films and TPS hybrid bio-composite films were produced by the casting method and the effects of the OPEFB microcrystalline cellulose (C)/nano-bentonite (B) ratio on the mechanical properties of the resultant TPS bio-composite films were studied. The highest tensile strength, Young&#x02019;s modulus and tensile toughness was achieved when the TPS was incorporated with 4 wt% B and 1% of C filler (TPS/4B1C). The use of this hybrid filler system resulted in a more significant enhancement in the tensile properties of the film as compared to the single B or C filler. The results signify that B/C hybrid fillers have brought a positive synergistic effect to the TPS matrix. The good compatibility between C, B and TPS was observed through the FTIR, XRD and SEM analyses. The findings demonstrate that the combination of the OPEFB microcrystalline cellulose and nano-bentonite can produce an efficient hybrid filler system that allows for greater enhancement in the mechanical properties of the TPS-based film for packaging applications. Our work signifies that this hybridization approach is a powerful method to toughen the TPS film. This encourages further exploration on the potential of this hybrid filler system for toughening other bio-polymers/polymers. More importantly, all the ingredients used to form the hybrid TPS bio-composite are environmentally friendly and renewable, thus contributing to the development of sustainable packaging materials.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Publisher&#x02019;s Note:</bold> MDPI stays neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.</p></fn></fn-group><notes><title>Author Contributions</title><p>Conceptualization, A.F.O. and S.A.A.; data curation, D.S.L. and A.A.A.; formal analysis, D.S.L. and A.A.A.; investigation, A.F.O. and D.S.L.; methodology, A.F.O., D.S.L. and I.I.; project administration, A.F.O., S.A.A. and I.I.; software, M.N.A.S. and A.U.-H.; writing&#x02014;original draft, D.S.L.; writing&#x02014;review and editing, A.F.O., M.N.A.S. and A.U.-H.
