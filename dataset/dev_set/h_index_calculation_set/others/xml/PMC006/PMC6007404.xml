This control is often exerted at the initiation of transcription, the first step in gene expression. All multi-subunit RNA polymerases (RNAPs) share structural similarities and catalyze RNA synthesis using the same fundamental mechanism. It is therefore not surprising that they share common strategies for transcriptional regulation (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). One such strategy is the presence of factor(s), which interact with RNAP and with the DNA. These interactions serve to transform a subpar recognition site (promoter) for RNAP into an excellent site, either by increasing the affinity of the polymerase for the promoter, increasing the rate of DNA unwinding at the start site, and/or increasing the rate at which RNAP clears the promoter (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>).</p><p>In bacteria, the core RNAP associates with a &#x003c3; specificity factor to generate the functional holoenzyme (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). The primary &#x003c3; factor in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> is &#x003c3;<sup>70</sup>, which functions during exponential growth, while alternate &#x003c3;&#x02019;s are used during other conditions such as times of stress (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). Promoter recognition by &#x003c3;<sup>70</sup> is achieved through specific interactions between two regions of &#x003c3; and two DNA elements: Region 2.4/3 with the &#x02013;10 /extended &#x02013;10 element and Region 4 with the &#x02013;35 element (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6&#x02013;8</xref>). When bacteriophage T4 infects <italic>E. coli</italic>, the phage hijacks and uses the host RNAP, and it does this in three temporal stages (reviewed in (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>)). &#x02018;Early&#x02019; T4 promoters simply compete successfully with host promoters for polymerase, while &#x02018;late&#x02019; promoters employ a specific T4-encoded &#x003c3; factor that replaces &#x003c3;<sup>70</sup>. In contrast, the activation of &#x02018;middle&#x02019; promoters involves two phage proteins, the co-activator AsiA and the activator MotA, that structurally adapt the host RNAP/&#x003c3; factor complex to specifically recognize the T4 middle promoter sequence. In this novel process called &#x003c3; appropriation, AsiA binds tightly to free &#x003c3;<sup>70</sup> and remodels the structure of Region 4 (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>) such that this portion of &#x003c3;<sup>70</sup> no longer interacts with its partner in RNAP core or with the host &#x02013;35 element (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). Instead, the C-terminal residues of &#x003c3;<sup>70</sup> become the binding partner for MotA that, in turn, recognizes and binds to the MotA box motif [5&#x02032; (a/t)(a/t)(a/t)TGCTTtA3&#x02032;, centered at position -30] present within T4 middle promoter DNA.</p><p>MotA contains two domains connected by a flexible linker region (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). The N-terminal activation domain MotA<sup>NTD</sup> interacts with the remodeled &#x003c3;<sup>70</sup> factor (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>), and the C-terminal domain MotA<sup>CTD</sup> can recognize and bind the MotA box motif (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). The structures of MotA<sup>NTD</sup> (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>) and MotA<sup>CTD</sup> in the absence of DNA (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>) have both been determined. MotA<sup>CTD</sup> adopts an unusual &#x02018;double-wing&#x02019; saddle fold comprising three &#x003b1;-helices atop an antiparallel 6-stranded &#x003b2;-sheet, and the many basic residues on the exposed surface of the &#x003b2;-sheet saddle suggested that this engages the DNA. This mode of binding was supported by analyses using the chemical cleaving agent FeBABE that generated a model for how MotA binds DNA within the AsiA/RNAP/MotA/DNA transcription complex (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>). This model predicts that MotA<sup>CTD</sup> straddles the major groove. However, it also suggests that the MotA linker contributes to DNA binding by engaging the minor groove in the upstream portion of the MotA motif.</p><p>The uniqueness of the double-wing domain suggested that it represents a new way in which a small protein module can recognize and bind DNA. In this paper, we report the crystal structure of the MotA<sup>linker/CTD</sup>&#x02013;DNA complex as revealed by four independent copies of the complex in the crystal, two cognate and two non-cognate with respect to the MotA box motif. Consistent with our previous model (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>), MotA<sup>CTD</sup> binds the DNA across the major groove via multiple interactions with the flanking sugar-phosphate backbones. It uses just three amino acids to &#x02018;read&#x02019; the MotA box motif, and one of these amino acids is provided by the flexible N-terminal linker region that interacts both specifically and non-specifically with the minor groove. In wild type T4 DNA, position 5 of cytosines are modified via hydroxymethylation/glucosylation. MotA<sup>CTD</sup> provides a cavity within the complex that is ideally positioned and structured to accommodate this moiety and thereby increase the strength and specificity of the interaction. Binding and mutagenesis experiments based on the crystal structure confirm the importance of this cavity and reveal that the sugar provides an additional recognition determinant for the protein.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="SEC2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec id="SEC2-1"><title>Cloning and protein production</title><p>The gene for the C-terminal domain and linker region of MotA (MotA<sup>linker/CTD</sup>, amino acids 93&#x02013;211) was cloned into the bacterial expression vector pET21a(+) (Novagen), and MotA<sup>linker/CTD</sup> was expressed in BL21(DE3) cells (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>).

All further steps were carried out at 4&#x000b0;C. Cells were harvested by centrifugation at 13 000 &#x000d7; <italic>g</italic> for 10 min, and pellets (1.5&#x02013;2.6 g) were resuspended in 42 ml sonication buffer [20 mM Tris&#x02013;HCl (pH 7.9), 1 mM EDTA, 10% glycerol, 50 mM NaCl, 1 mM &#x000df;-mercaptoethanol, 1 mM benzamidine]. After lysis by sonication, the resulting fraction was centrifuged at 8750 &#x000d7; <italic>g</italic> for 30 min to remove cell debris. The supernatant was checked for equivalent conductivity with sonication buffer and corrected as needed. Eight milliliter of an equilibrated 50% slurry of phosphocellulose resin (P11 Cellulose Phosphate cation exchanger, Whatman) was added to the supernatant and gently rocked overnight, then loaded into a 30 ml disposable column with a gravity drip. The column was washed with sonication buffer (20 ml) and then with sonication buffer containing increasing concentrations of NaCl (10 ml of 0.2 M, 10 ml of 0.3 M, 8 &#x000d7; 4 ml of 0.4 M, 10 ml of 0.5 M, and 10 ml of 0.8 M NaCl).

Previous work has indicated that the MotA<sup>CTD</sup> can interact with MotA box DNA (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>), and our recent modeling suggested that the MotA linker also contributes to binding. Consequently, with the goal of optimizing the MotA construct for crystallization of the complex, we repeated the SPR experiment using the same dsDNA segment and a MotA<sup>linker/CTD</sup> construct encompassing residues 93&#x02013;211, which includes residues 93&#x02013;104 from the linker.

A cognate MotA<sup>linker/CTD</sup> from one complex forms a dimer with the non-cognate MotA<sup>linker/CTD</sup> from the adjacent complex to create the crystal asymmetric unit. As observed in the MotA<sup>CTD</sup> crystal structure without DNA (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>), the double-wing domain has a propensity to form side-by-side multimers via the six-stranded &#x003b2;-sheet, which explains this packing scheme.

The hydroxyl group of Tyr134 forms a hydrogen bond with the N4 nitrogen atom of cytosine C10 in the C10-G13&#x02032; base pair, and the adjacent Arg135 is hydrogen bonded to the guanine G9 of the G9-C14&#x02032; base pair (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C</xref> and&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Table S2</xref>). Arg101 is hydrogen bonded to the O2 oxygen atom of thymine T6 in the T6-A17&#x02032; base pair in the minor groove, which emphasizes the key role of the linker in the cognate complex (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2D</xref>). Consistent with our previous studies (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>), the linker region has a number of additional interactions with the minor groove (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2D</xref>). Thr100, Lys102 and Arg104 interact with phosphate groups, and Arg98 appears to penetrate the minor groove to interact with base pairs A3-T20&#x02032;/G4-C19&#x02032; although the electron density at this peripheral region is quite weak. The linker region in complex C is less well resolved but the visible proximal region also engages the minor groove with Arg104 clearly interacting with adjacent phosphate groups.</p><p>The two non-specific complexes B and D are very similar to the two specific complexes. This is not surprising because they are mediated by the same side interactions with the DNA phosphate groups. This similarity is evident when all four complexes are superimposed (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S6</xref>). Closer examination reveals that both complexes are partially specific because there is a fortuitous GC base pair (G4&#x02032;-C19) in each that interacts with Arg135 in the same fashion that this residue interacts with the G9-C14&#x02032; base pair in the MotA box motif. However, Tyr134 is opposite an AT base pair and makes no interaction with the bases (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Table S2</xref>). Complex B is less tight than the other three, which is probably a result of it being less well packed in the crystal lattice. The role, if any, of the linker region in the non-specific complexes cannot be distinguished in the structure because the DNA construct does not extend far enough to permit this interaction.</p></sec><sec id="SEC3-3"><title>A polar cavity accommodates 5-glucosylated, hydroxymethylated cytosine</title><p>Wild type T4 DNA is modified by both &#x003b1;- and &#x003b2;-D-glucosyltransferases, which add a glucosylated, hydroxymethyl group at position 5 of cytosines.

To directly test this, we performed electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs) to determine the ability of various modified DNA fragments to compete with a 5&#x02032;-<sup>32</sup>P end-labeled, 19 base pair fragment containing unmodified MotA box DNA. We only used the &#x003b2;-<sc>d</sc>-glucosyl-5-hydroxymethyl-deoxycytosine modification for these experiments because the &#x003b1;-D-glucosyltransferase enzyme is unavailable. We first tested the following fragments: no modification, hydroxymethyl moieties on both Cs within the MotA box motif, and glucosylated, hydroxymethyl modification on both C&#x02019;s (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref>). Fully modified DNA was significantly more competitive than either the unmodified or the hydroxymethyl modified fragments. As expected (<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>), a mutant fragment that does not contain a MotA box motif did not compete.

The 2-fold drop in activity for Y134A/R135A is significant and suggests weaker binding to the MotA-box motif. However, it may also reflect that the loss of two central side chains impacts the folded structure of the protein.</p><p>The EMSA (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S9B</xref>) and SPR analyses (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Table S4</xref>) are far more sensitive indicators of the isolated MotA-DNA interaction. In EMSAs using unmodified DNA, we observed serious binding defects for the single R135A variant and the Y134A/R135A double mutant. This was confirmed by SPR that showed no detectable binding with either fully unmodified or unmodified DNA on the top strand and severely impaired binding for fully modified or DNA modified on the top strand. In addition, the EMSAs revealed that binding of the unmodified DNA was less stable with these variant proteins, as evidenced by the smear of radioactivity extending from the bound species to the free DNA (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S9B</xref>). Once again, the Y134A/R135A impairment may be due to protein misfolding but Arg135 clearly has a key role in the interaction. Although Y134A protein behaved similarly to wt in the EMSA, SPR revealed impaired DNA binding, but to a lesser extent than R135A. Finally, the EMSA and SPR analyses of E153A, which we predict should selectively affect the interaction with the DNA modified on the top strand, were equivocal. The EMSAs showed a slightly tighter binding to DNA and no difference with DNA modified on the top strand (data not shown), and SPR also revealed a significantly tighter binding to unmodified DNA. In our model shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>, Glu153 forms two hydrogen bonds with the glucose moiety of the DNA modifying group, but the van der Waals interaction within the large cavity is far more extensive. We suggest that the tighter binding of E153A with DNA results from the loss of the negative charge and increased electrostatic interaction with the DNA backbone. This is consistent with the observation (see Materials and Methods) that MotAE153A elutes from the phosphocellulose column at a higher salt concentration.</p></sec><sec id="SEC3-5"><title>The DNA structure is minimally distorted in the MotA<sup>linker/CTD</sup>&#x02013;DNA Complex</title><p>Compared to standard B-form DNA, the DNA conformation in the MotA<sup>linker/CTD</sup> &#x02013;DNA complex is largely undistorted by the interaction with the protein (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S10</xref>). The DNA coordinates within the complex were uploaded to the W3DNA web server <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://w3dna.rutgers.edu">http://w3dna.rutgers.edu</ext-link> (<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>) to analyze the DNA conformation, and the key parameters are shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Table S5</xref>. The only distortions of any significance occur in the top strand where the MotA box motif interacts with Tyr134 and Arg135, the DNA backbone interacts with multiple side chains, and the linker region penetrates the minor groove. In the latter region, the DNA backbone moves towards the protein by &#x0223c;2.2 &#x000c5; and the minor groove opens by &#x0223c;2.3 &#x000c5;. Thus, MotA<sup>linker/CTD</sup> is ideally structured to recognize the B-DNA conformation, which explains how it can also form a non-specific complex, and is consistent with previous biochemical analyses indicating that binding by MotA does not significantly distort the DNA (<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>). We recognize that the DNA may become more distorted when the complex accommodates 5-glucosylated, hydroxymethylated cytosine, but the open binding cavity for this moiety suggests that this would be minimal. It is also surprising that the DNA is not bent towards the bound protein because many of the negatively charged phosphate groups at the interface interact with neutralizing basic residues. However, this may be a crystal artifact because the second copy of MotA<sup>linker/CTD</sup> is bound to the opposite face of the DNA, which may cancel out any bending towards the protein in the opposite complex.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="SEC4"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>Our work has identified a new protein-DNA complex in which a 6-stranded anti-parallel &#x003b2;-sheet engages and straddles the major groove. The binding is mediated by two sets of basic and polar residues on either side of the &#x003b2;-sheet that interact with the two sugar-phosphate backbones. In contrast to modules like the helix-turn-helix in which an &#x003b1;-helix penetrates the major groove and &#x02018;reads&#x02019; the base pairs, MotA<sup>CTD</sup> uses two residues from the surface of the &#x003b2;-sheet and one residue from the linker region to access the cognate MotA box motif via the major and minor grooves, respectively. Another feature of the complex is the use of a basic and flexible short polypeptide to augment the binding by interacting with the DNA minor groove using both electrostatic and hydrogen bonding interactions with the DNA backbone and interactions with the bases via arginine side chains. We previously tried unsuccessfully to crystallize the complex using MotA<sup>CTD</sup> constructs lacking the N-terminal linker, and the inclusion of this element prompted by our earlier studies (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>) proved to be pivotal. The binding of arginine side chains into the minor groove has recently been shown to be an important shape/specificity determinant factor in protein-DNA complexes (<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>). It is typically associated with AT-rich tracks and a compressed minor groove, and although Arg101 does engage the T6-A17&#x02032; base pair within the 5&#x02032;-T6-T7-T8-3&#x02032; sequence, the minor groove is not obviously compressed in this region.</p><p>Our crystal structure also shows that this mode of binding can create a reasonably tight non-specific complex. Our DNA construct is longer than is required for the specific MotA<sup>linker/CTD</sup> complex, but this allowed a second MotA<sup>linker/CTD</sup> to bind independently on the opposite face of the DNA. Thus, it was possible to visualize both cognate and non-cognate complexes in our structure. This is not altogether surprising given the previous work indicating that MotA accepts many deviations from its consensus sequence (<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>,<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>,<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>,<xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>). In addition, although the MotA box motif consensus sequence contains a highly conserved GC base pair within its center (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>), previous work has indicated that unmodified DNA is fully competent for MotA binding (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>) and MotA/AsiA activation of transcription (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>). Furthermore, MotA does not require a specific base determinant at the GC base pair and can accept base substitutions at these positions (<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>).</p><p>Although AsiA and MotA analogs have been identified in dozens of T4-like phages, a process similar to &#x003c3; appropriation has not been observed outside phage. However, the novel double-wing structure has been reported for two proteins of unknown function, the conserved <italic>E. coli</italic> YjbR (<xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>) and the <italic>Pseudomonas syringae</italic> protein Pspto_3016 (20,43). Thus, an understanding of how MotA interacts with its partner DNA will yield important insights into the functions of these proteins and other as yet unidentified members of the family. Another protein that contains this domain is the phage T4 SF2 helicase UvsW. UvsW has a key role in T4 recombination and is functionally and structurally related to the eukaryotic Rad54 protein (<xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>,<xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>). It also contains a double-wing subdomain and the MotA<sup>linker/CTD</sup> complex now provides insights into its role. The largely non-specific interactions via the sugar-phosphate backbone in the complex may allow MotA to search for the MotA box motif by &#x02018;riding along&#x02019; the DNA via the saddle-like surface of the double-wing domain (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S11A</xref>). UvsW translocates and remodels three-way and four-way DNA junctions, and the MotA-like domain is ideally positioned to bind one of the translocating dsDNA arms (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S11B</xref>). The HARP domain of the SF2 helicase SMARCAL1 is structurally similar to the MotA-like domain of UvsW and has been shown to have a similar function (<xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>). Other examples of protein&#x02013;DNA interactions that are mediated by &#x003b2;-sheets include the TATA-binding protein (<xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>), EcoRV (<xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>), MutS (<xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>,<xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>) and the Met repressor (<xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>).</p><p>The isolated MotA<sup>linker/CTD</sup>&#x02013;DNA complex observed in our crystal must be consistent with the structure for MotA/DNA within the entire MotA/RNAP/AsiA/DNA transcription complex. Structural models for the MotA/DNA complex (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>) and the complete transcription complex (<xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>) have been developed, and the agreement is excellent (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S12</xref>). This also confirms that no significant change in the structure of the complex occurs when the transcription complex is formed. Most significantly, the linker region between the N- and C-terminal halves of MotA, located within the minor groove of the upstream portion of the MotA box motif, is crucial for connecting the MotA<sup>NTD</sup> domain and its protein partner, the C-terminus of &#x003c3;<sup>70</sup>, with MotA<sup>CTD</sup> present on the DNA. Thus, through this mechanism, the phage converts the specificity of the host RNA polymerase from recognition of its typical -35 element motif in host promoter DNA to the MotA box sequence present in T4 middle promoters. The extra affinity afforded by the modification present on T4 DNA serves to ensure even greater specificity in this process.</p><p>Finally, the docking of MotA<sup>CTD</sup> to the major groove of DNA via a &#x003b2;-sheet rather than a penetrating &#x003b1;-helix creates space at the interface that the module exploits to create a cavity that recognizes and binds a glucosylated, hydroxymethyl modification to the T4 DNA cytosines. Consequently, as evidenced by the EMSA and SPR binding experiments, what is a low specificity complex from a base determinant perspective becomes much more specific from the presence of the sugar moiety on the top strand of the cytosine at the center of the MotA box motif. Many eukaryotic transcription factors are required to recognize and bind target sites on DNA that have been chemically modified by epigenetic processes, and recent work has revealed many transcription factors that preferentially target sequences that contain methylcytosine (<xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>). Thus, our work has wider implications for the ways in which DNA modifications can extend the uniqueness of small DNA motifs to facilitate the specificity of protein-DNA interactions.</p></sec><sec id="SEC5"><title>DATA AVAILABILITY</title><p>Structures are available in the PDB under ID 5JLT.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="sup1"><label>Supplementary Data</label><media xlink:href="gky292_supp.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS</title><p>We thank Darcie Miller, Eric Enemark and Stefan Gajewski for crystallographic advice and Kenneth Kreuzer for his insights and support.
