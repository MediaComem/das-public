The AER, which is the airflow into and out of a building, is a primary mechanism for entry of outdoor air pollutants and removal of indoor source emissions. The mechanistic Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory (LBL) AER model was linked to a leakage area model to predict AER from questionnaires and meteorology. The LBL model was also extended to include natural ventilation (LBLX). Using literature-reported parameter values, AER predictions from LBL and LBLX models were compared to data from 642 daily AER measurements across 31 detached homes in central North Carolina, with corresponding questionnaires and meteorological observations. Data was collected on seven consecutive days during each of four consecutive seasons. For the individual model-predicted and measured AER, the median absolute difference was 43% (0.17 h<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>) and 40% (0.17 h<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>) for the LBL and LBLX models, respectively. Additionally, a literature-reported empirical scale factor (SF) AER model was evaluated, which showed a median absolute difference of 50% (0.25 h<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>). The capability of the LBL, LBLX, and SF models could help reduce the AER uncertainty in air pollution exposure models used to develop exposure metrics for health studies.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="short"><p>Evaluation of models to predict residential air exchange rates from questionnaires and meteorology is conducted.</p></abstract><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>document-id-old-9</meta-name><meta-value>es101800k</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>document-id-new-14</meta-name><meta-value>es-2010-01800k</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>ccc-price</meta-name><meta-value/></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><!--with a head--><sec id="sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Numerous air pollution epidemiology studies have observed associations between ambient concentrations of particulate matter (PM) and increased rates of morbidity and mortality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>). These health studies often use air pollution measurements from central ambient monitoring sites as exposure surrogates. To better understand the linkages between ambient concentrations and exposures, we are developing an air pollution exposure model for individuals (EMI) in health studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>&#x02212;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>). The EMI predicts personal exposures from ambient concentrations and questionnaire information such as building characteristics, occupant behavior related to building operation and indoor sources, and time-activity patterns. This study describes a critical aspect of the EMI: the evaluation of models that can predict the air exchange rate (AER) of individual homes based on questionnaire and meteorological data.</p><p>A residential AER model has several potential applications. First, the AER, which is the airflow into and out of a home, is an important mechanism for the entry of outdoor air pollutants and the removal of indoor source emissions. Since studies have shown that people in the United States and Canada spend approximately 66% of their time indoors at home, the residential AER is a critical parameter for air pollution exposure models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>). Field data collection costs and participant burden often limit the number of AER measurements, as well as in-home and personal air pollutant measurements. Therefore, a residential AER model integrated within an exposure model is a feasible method to determine exposure metrics for epidemiological analysis and risk assessments. Second, a mechanistic AER model has the potential ability to reduce the AER uncertainties that can exist in air pollution exposure models that often rely upon empirical AER models designed without a physical basis, or AER measurements in other homes. Third, an AER model can be applied for both individual and population air pollution exposure models in support of cohort and time-series health studies, and regulatory exposure assessments. The AER model inputs, which include housing characteristics and occupant behavior as related to building operation, can be obtained from questionnaires for individual-based models, and obtained from public databases such as censuses, property assessments, residential surveys (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>), occupant window opening surveys (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>) for population-based models. Finally, an AER model can be used for censored or missing measurements.</p><p>Mechanistic AER models, which account for the physical driving forces of the airflows (i.e., pressure differences across building envelope from wind and indoor&#x02212;outdoor temperature differences, the stack effect), can be classified into two major categories: single-zone and multizone models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>). Single-zone models predict the AER for a whole building represented as a single, well-mixed compartment. Multizone models divide a building into a series of interconnected compartments with distinct pressures and temperatures. The input data required for the more complex multizone models (e.g., spatial configuration of windows, doors, and internal walls) are typically unavailable from questionnaires in health studies due to field data collection cost and participant burden. In this study, we consider single-zone models since these models are appropriate for buildings with no internal resistance to airflow, such as the single family homes included in the analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>).</p><p>Various single-zone AER models have been described in the literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>). Two of the most widely used mechanistic models are the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory (LBL) model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>) and the Alberta air infiltration (AIM-2) model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>). The AIM-2 model requires parameter values for the leakage coefficient and pressure exponent for individual homes that are derived from whole-building pressurization tests. The LBL model requires the effective leakage area for individual homes that can be derived from either whole-building pressurization tests (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>) or leakage area models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>). Since pressurization tests for individual homes in cohort health studies are not feasible due to field data collection cost, we used the LBL model coupled to a leakage area model in this study. Another study that linked the LBL model with a leakage area model, population-level data from the U.S. Census Bureau and the Residential Energy Consumption Survey (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>) were used to predict the average AER for each county in the US, and no model evaluation was performed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>). In this study, questionnaire data were used as inputs for the LBL model to predict AER for individual homes, which were then compared with corresponding AER measurements.</p><p>The LBL model predicts the AER due to airflow through small unintentional openings in the building envelope (i.e., air infiltration), but does not account for the airflow through large controllable openings (i.e., natural ventilation), such as open windows. In this study, we addressed this limitation by extending the LBL model (LBLX) using a previously developed model to predict the natural ventilation airflow through large controllable openings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>). We evaluated the LBLX model with window opening input data from questionnaires, and corresponding AER measurements.</p><p>In this study, we also evaluated an empirical scaling factor (SF) AER model that was reported in the literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>). The SF model does not consider the driving forces from the wind (wind speed) and stack (indoor&#x02212;outdoor temperature differences) effects. Instead, a scaling constant is used to relate leakage area to AER.</p><p>The AER has been measured in a few thousand homes in the U.S., but these measurements typically did not include sufficient details on housing characteristics and occupant behavior, which are needed for model inputs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref>). The Research Triangle Park Particulate Matter Panel Study (RTP Panel Study), provides a unique data set to evaluate the residential AER models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref>&#x02212;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref>). The RTP Panel Study included daily residential AER measurements, meteorological data, and questionnaires on housing characteristics and occupant behavior related to building operation (i.e., window opening, indoor temperature) of 31 occupied detached homes for seven consecutive days in each of four consecutive seasons, thus representing various housing characteristics, occupant behavior, and weather conditions.</p><p>In this study, we used the questionnaires, meteorology, and AER measurements from the RTP Panel Study to evaluate the LBL, LBLX, and SF AER models (Table <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">1</xref>).

Research Laboratory of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, represented a one year investigation of PM and related gaseous copollutants involving participants living across a 70 km distance in the vicinity of RTP in central North Carolina (NC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref>&#x02212;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref>). The study included a low to moderate socioeconomic status cohort of 29 participants with controlled hypertension living in Raleigh, NC, and a moderate socioeconomic status cohort of eight participants with implanted cardiac defibrillators living in Chapel Hill, NC. Personal, residential indoor, residential outdoor and central-site ambient air monitoring was performed for seven consecutive days in each of four consecutive seasons (summer 2000 through spring 2001). All 24 h daily measurements were performed from 8 a.m. to 8 a.m. (&#x000b1;2 h) the following day. A maximum of six participants and their residences were monitored during each seven day period within each season. Monitoring during each season lasted approximately six weeks. Daily 24 h average AER were measured in each home using a perfluorocarbon tracer (PFT) method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref>). The Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL; Upton, NY) prepared the tracer sources and receptor tubes, and provided guidance on the types and number of tracer sources placed in each home. Sources were placed in the homes 24 h before the first day of measurement to allow for adequate distribution. The reported accuracy (based on known AER), precision (based on replicate measurements), and limits of the PFT-derived AER measurements for occupied homes is estimated to be 20&#x02212;25%, 5&#x02212;15%, and 0.2&#x02212;5.0 h<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref>&#x02212;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">23</xref>).</p><p>Data were also obtained on housing characteristics, occupant behavior, and meteorology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref24">24</xref>). Daily questionnaires and time-activity diaries were collected for each subject. Participants recorded their location at 15 min intervals and time when certain activities related to housing operation were performed, including opening windows. For each open window, the opening height and duration was recorded. Indoor temperatures were measured continuously (1 min) at each home. Outdoor temperatures and wind speeds (2 m elevation) were measured hourly at a local State of NC air monitoring platform in Raleigh, NC.</p><p>The RTP Panel Study consisted of 37 participants living in 36 unique residences; two participants were family members living in the same house. The housing types of these residences consisted of 31 detached homes, three trailers, one duplex, and one apartment. In this paper, we evaluated the model for the 31 detached homes. The sample size for the other housing types was too small for sufficient analysis.</p></sec><!--with a head--><sec id="sec2.2"><title>Air Exchange Rate Model Overview</title><p>The exchange of outdoor air with air inside a building can be divided into three categories: air infiltration, natural ventilation, and mechanical ventilation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>). Air infiltration is the airflow across building envelope from air leakage through small cracks around windows, doors, and other unintentional openings in the building envelope. Natural ventilation is the intentional airflow through open windows, doors, and other designed and controlled openings in the building envelope. Mechanical ventilation is the forced air movement by outdoor-vented intake and exhaust fans. In this study, all three AER models (LBL, LBLX, SF) include air infiltration, with natural ventilation included in the LBLX model (Table <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). Mechanical ventilation is not included in these residential AER models since detailed information on the specific type and operation of outdoor-vented fans was unavailable from the RTP Panel Study.</p><p>The driving mechanisms for AER are pressure differences across building envelope (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>). The pressure differences for air infiltration and natural ventilation are induced by wind (wind effect) and indoor&#x02212;outdoor temperature differences (stack effect). In this study, the two mechanistic models (LBL and LBLX) include the wind and stack effects from wind speed and temperature measurements, respectively (Table <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">1</xref>).</p><p>We developed computer simulations for the three models (LBL, LBLX, SF) to predict 24 h average AER, which are time-matched to the 24 h average AER measurements from the RTP Panel Study.

The parameters for the low-income homes were estimated using measurements from the Ohio Weatherization Program, which included residences with household incomes below 125% of the poverty guideline (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>). In the RTP Panel Study, the individual household incomes were not collected. From the 2000 U.S. Census, household income distributions are not available at the block level, but only at the block group level. Therefore, we examined the household income distributions at the block group for the 31 homes in the RTP Panel Study. Since each block group typically consisted of 1000 households, and the household incomes within each block group were not homogeneous in the study area, our ability to estimate the individual household incomes is limited. However, for the Raleigh cohort, a substantial percentage of households in each block group were below 125% of the 2000 poverty guideline. For the Chapel Hill cohort, a small percentage of households in each block group were below 125% of the poverty guideline. Therefore, the literature-reported parameter values for the low-income and conventional homes were used for the Raleigh and Chapel Hill cohorts, respectively.</p><p>To determine the model inputs <italic>T</italic><sub>in</sub>, <italic>T</italic><sub>out</sub>, <italic>U</italic>, &#x02009;and <italic>V</italic>, we used data from the RTP Panel Study (<xref rid="si1" ref-type="notes">Supporting Information</xref> Tables S5&#x02212;S6).

This grouping yielded 110 stack-dominated days and 132 wind-dominated days.

Using literature-reported parameter values, the mechanistic LBL and LBLX models performed slightly better overall than the empirical SF model, and the individual model-predicted AER from these three models agreed reasonably well to the 642 daily AER measurements across 31 detached homes from the RTP Panel Study. These results suggest that it is possible to apply these models for individual-level air pollution exposure assessments that require house-specific predictions of daily AER. Since the summary statistics for the overall model-predicted and measured AER distributions also correspond reasonably well, these models potentially could be also applied for population-level exposure assessments. Furthermore, since the LBLX model can separately predict the AER for the air infiltration pathway and natural ventilation pathway, its integration with indoor air quality models could support the use of unique pathway-dependent penetration coefficients for certain air pollutants.</p><p>We can compare the AER models with those reported in the literature. For the SF model, one study qualitatively fit a model-predicted AER distribution to a national distribution of measured AER across the United States, and reported the spread of the distributions were in good agreement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>). Other studies have evaluated the LBL model using whole-building pressurization measurements to determine the leakage area. In one study, the LBL model had a mean |&#x003b5;| of 25% across 16 detached homes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref29">29</xref>). In another study, the LBL model had a mean |&#x003b5;| of 26&#x02212;46% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref30">30</xref>). Our implementation of the LBL model, which uses a leakage area model, had a mean |&#x003b5;| of 43%. Given the limitations of the leakage area model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>) and single-zone AER models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>), the measurement uncertainty of the PFT-derived AER data (accuracy of 20&#x02212;25% and precision of 5&#x02212;15% for occupied homes) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">23</xref>), and the use of literature-reported parameter values in this study (i.e., no model fitting), our results for the LBL, LBLX, and SF models are reasonable. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first time the LBL model has been extended to include natural ventilation (LBLX model) and evaluated with window-opening behavior data. Therefore, the LBLX model cannot be compared with similar models reported in the literature.</p><p>In this study, similar results were obtained for the mechanistic models that include both air infiltration and natural ventilation (LBLX) or only air infiltration (LBL). The LBL model may perform reasonably well since the effect from opening windows may only moderately increase the 24 h average AER. It is possible that windows are opened for only a few hours, whereas the air infiltration (i.e., unintentional openings) is constant. Also, windows may be opened more often on days with small indoor&#x02212;outdoor temperature differences. Therefore, the driving force from the stack effect may be smaller on days with windows opened. Furthermore, the stack effect can be reduced after windows are opened from the thermal equilibrium created between indoor and outdoor temperatures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref31">31</xref>). This provides a potential explanation for the median measured AER being highest in the winter (0.81 h<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>) and lowest in the summer (0.36 h<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>) even though the number of days with open windows was lowest in the winter (22%) and highest in the summer (44%), with the median indoor&#x02212;outdoor temperature difference highest in the winter (14.4 &#x000b0;C) and lowest in the summer (2.1 &#x000b0;C), and similar median wind speeds in the winter (4.8 km hr<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>) and summer (5.0 km hr<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>). The median AER predicted with the LBL and LBLX models were also highest in the winter (0.63 h<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>,0.64 h<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>) and lowest in the summer (0.25 h<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>, 0.27 h<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>), respectively. Another study showed similar results with the median AER measured across 99 homes in Houston, Texas being highest in the winter (0.63 h<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>) and lowest in the summer (0.37 h<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref32">32</xref>). Since the LBL model does not require window opening data, this reduces participant burden and makes it more feasible to apply the model for health studies. The ability of the LBL and LBLX models to predict AER in other geographical areas with different seasonal window-opening behavior will be investigated with other exposure panel studies.</p><p>The selection of the preferable AER model(s) for a particular situation depends on the available data and the desired temporal resolution. The SF model is simpler since fewer input data are required, as compared to the LBL and LBLX models. However, the SF model has low temporal resolution (annual). The LBL and LBLX models have higher temporal resolution (e.g., hourly) but require more detailed input data than the SF model, which includes the indoor temperature, outdoor temperature, and wind speed. The SF and LBL models account for only air infiltration, whereas the LBLX model also includes natural ventilation. However, this requires additional input data (e.g., window opening height and duration) for the LBLX model.&#x0201d; Therefore, the SF model is preferable when limited data is available, whereas the LBL and LBLX models are preferable when high temporal resolution is desired and more detailed data is available.</p><p>The method to characterize the model uncertainty depends on the particular application. For estimating individual air pollutant exposures for specific people, such as those in cohort health studies with individual health outcomes, a comparison of the individual measured and model-predicted AER for each home would be appropriate. However, for estimating population distributions of air pollutant exposures for groups of people such as those in health studies with health outcomes at census tract to county level resolution, a comparison of the distributions of the measured and model-predicted AER across all homes would be appropriate. In this study, we performed both types of comparisons. The AER uncertainty determined from these comparisons could be used for uncertainty analysis (e.g., Monte Carlo simulations) of residential indoor air quality models.</p><p>Using mean values for certain parameters may increase the model uncertainty for individual-level AER estimates greater than the uncertainty for population-level AER estimates across a geographical region (e.g., zip code or city). This will likely be the case for mean population-level estimates, but not necessarily for estimates at the upper and lower percentiles (e.g., 95th and 5th percentiles). Also, this will depend on the distributions of these parameters and the errors across the region. In this study, using mean values for specific parameters could account for a substantial amount of the individual differences between measured and model-predicted AER, especially for the LBL and LBLX models that require more data.</p><p>Even though our model evaluation was based on AER of detached homes in central NC, we expect similar results for the LBL and LBLX models in detached homes with similar building characteristics, weather conditions, and occupant behavior. Since the LBL and LBLX models include the underlying physical mechanisms for the driving forces (i.e., wind and stack effects), these models in theory should perform similarly for different weather conditions. The ability of the LBL and LBLX models to predict AER in other geographical areas with different housing stock, weather, and occupant behavior needs to be investigated. To address this limitation of the study, we plan to perform additional model evaluation using other exposure panel studies such as the Detroit Exposure and Aerosol Research Study in Detroit, Michigan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">22</xref>). In this study, we evaluated the models with data from the RTP Panel Study in central North Carolina since we are planning our initial model application for cohort health studies with participants living in the same geographical location.</p><p>Another limitation of this study is that mechanical ventilation could not be included in the AER models due to unavailable data. The modeling of AER was not a primary goal of the RTP Panel Study, and therefore detailed information on the specific type and operation of outdoor-vented fans was unavailable to accurately estimate their effect on the daily AER for individual homes. Typical bathroom fans, outdoor-vented kitchen range hoods, and clothes dryers have low-intermediate airflows and are used intermittently. Other types of outdoor-vented fans such as window fans, whole-house fans, and window/wall air conditioners operated with open outdoor vents can have a large effect on AER. These fans typically have intermediate (e.g., window/wall air conditioners) or high (e.g., window and whole-house fans) airflows. Whole-house fans are installed in few homes, and window/wall air conditioners can be operated with open or closed outdoor vents. The questionnaires did not distinguish between ceiling-mounted whole-house fans and roof-mounted attic fans. This distinction is important since whole-house fans ventilate the living space unlike attic fans that are designed to ventilate the attic. Whole-house fans move outdoor air into the living space through open windows by forcing air from the living space through the ceiling-mounted fan into the attic. Attic fans, which move outdoor air into the attic through the soffit or gable vents by forcing air from the attic through the roof-mounted fan to the outdoors, are expected to have a relatively small AER effect as compared to whole-house fans. Overall, we expect a small daily AER effect from bathroom fans and outdoor-vented kitchen range hoods, and a large AER effect from window/wall air conditioners (open outdoor vent), window fans, and whole-house fans. This will be investigated with other exposure panel studies that collected daily information on the use of mechanical ventilation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">22</xref>).</p><p>We conclude that our study demonstrates the feasibility of using the LBL, LBLX, and SF models to predict daily AER for individual homes from questionnaires and meteorology. Results show that the model-predicted AER agree reasonably well to the daily AER measurements across detached homes from the RTP Panel Study. This capability could help to reduce AER uncertainty in air pollution exposure models used to predict exposure metrics for epidemiological analysis in health studies.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>We thank Tom Long, Jennifer Richmond-Bryant, Lisa Baxter, Alexander Schneider, Haluk Ozkaynak, Alan Vette, Zhishi Guo, and Ronald Mosley for review comments and helpful suggestions.
