Despite the prevalence of this phenomenon, its functional impact is still poorly understood. Recent studies point to the importance of newly generated neurons to olfactory learning and memory. Adult neurogenesis is regulated by a variety of factors, notably by instances related to reproductive behavior, such as exposure to mating partners, pregnancy and lactation, and exposure to offspring. To study the contribution of olfactory neurogenesis to maternal behavior and social recognition, here we selectively disrupted OB neurogenesis using focal irradiation of the subventricular zone in adult female mice. We show that reduction of olfactory neurogenesis results in an abnormal social interaction pattern with male, but not female, conspecifics; we suggest that this effect could result from the inability to detect or discriminate male odors and could therefore have implications for the recognition of potential mating partners. Disruption of OB neurogenesis, however, neither impaired maternal-related behaviors, nor did it affect the ability of mothers to discriminate their own progeny from others.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>mate recognition</kwd><kwd>offspring recognition</kwd><kwd>maternal behavior</kwd><kwd>olfaction</kwd><kwd>neurogenesis</kwd><kwd>irradiation</kwd><kwd>social interaction</kwd></kwd-group><counts><fig-count count="14"/><table-count count="2"/><equation-count count="0"/><ref-count count="67"/><page-count count="17"/><word-count count="11735"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p>Adult neurogenesis is conserved in a variety of animals, ranging from insects to humans (reviewed in Lindsey and Tropepe, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">2006</xref>; Gould, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">2007</xref>), suggesting that this phenomenon is important to brain function. In the mammalian brain, two regions have been shown to receive neurons during adulthood: the olfactory bulb (OB) and the dentate gyrus (DG) of the hippocampus (reviewed in Alvarez-Buylla and Garcia-Verdugo, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">2002</xref>; Li et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">2009</xref>). Adult-born neurons that reach the olfactory system originate from neural precursors in the subventricular zone (SVZ) and migrate to the OB, where they differentiate into periglomerular and granule cells (PGs and GCs, respectively), two types of bulbar interneurons that are primarily GABAergic (Lledo and Saghatelyan, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">2005</xref>). These newly generated neurons are functionally integrated into the OB circuitry, as demonstrated by recording the activity evoked by their synaptic partners (Carleton et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">2003</xref>; Whitman and Greer, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B62">2007</xref>), and by measuring their responses to odor stimulation (Magavi et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">2005</xref>). Moreover, these adult-born granule cells also show unique properties: they exhibit enhanced synaptic plasticity (Nissant et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">2009</xref>) and increased responsiveness to odors (Magavi et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">2005</xref>), when compared to older granule cells.</p><p>Recent studies suggest that newly generated neurons play a role in learning and memory of olfactory information. Manipulations that alter the levels of neurogenesis affect olfactory behavior, but the effects depend on the nature of the manipulation as well as on the tasks used to assess olfactory function. For instance, rearing mice in an odor-enriched environment &#x02013; a manipulation that doubles the number of newly arriving neurons in the OB but not the hippocampus &#x02013; results in a longer-lasting odor memory (Rochefort et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">2002</xref>). On the other hand, reducing or blocking olfactory neurogenesis affects behavior in a task-dependent manner: while olfactory discrimination ability seems to be unaffected (Imayoshi et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">2008</xref>; Breton-Provencher et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">2009</xref>; Lazarini et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">2009</xref>), deficits in either long or short-term odor memory have been reported (Breton-Provencher et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">2009</xref>; Lazarini et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">2009</xref>; Valley et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B60">2009</xref>; Sultan et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B59">2010</xref>). In addition, in both perceptual and associative learning, newly generated neurons are differentially recruited to OB areas responsive to the odors learned (Alonso et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2006</xref>; Moreno et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">2009</xref>; Sultan et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B59">2010</xref>), suggesting that these neurons could contribute to changes in odor representations during learning.</p><p>A deeper understanding of the functional role of adult neurogenesis could come from studying the physiological conditions in which this process is regulated; such a modulation has been recently described in relation to reproductive behavior. In a study by Shingo et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">2003</xref>) proliferation of neuronal precursors in the SVZ was shown to increase in female mice during the first week of both pregnancy and lactation, resulting in augmented levels of neurogenesis in the OB. This modulation of neurogenesis seems to be mediated solely by prolactin (PRL), a mammalian hormone essential to maternal behavior (Mann and Bridges, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">2001</xref>). Other conditions regulate the levels of neurogenesis: exposing female mice to male pheromones produces an increase in neurogenesis in the females&#x02019; OB. Such male pheromone exposure also impacts female behavior: it is correlated with an advanced onset of maternal behavior (Larsen et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">2008</xref>), and it is required for the establishment or expression of females&#x02019; preference for a dominant male (Mak et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">2007</xref>). In addition, a recent study showed that neurogenesis in male OB is upregulated during the interaction of male mice with their offspring (Mak and Weiss, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">2010</xref>). Notably, the increase of olfactory neurogenesis in all these settings is mediated by PRL.</p><p>Reproductive behaviors rely heavily on the use of odor cues. For instance, anosmic female mice are unable to distinguish normal from castrated males (Lin et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">2005</xref>; Keller et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">2006</xref>), and show abnormal hormonal cycles and impaired mating behavior (Vandenbergh, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B61">1973</xref>). Olfaction is also fundamental to the establishment of maternal behavior, at least in certain species including sheep (L&#x000e9;vy et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">1995</xref>) and mice (Gandelman et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">1971</xref>; Vandenbergh, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B61">1973</xref>). Ewes use odor cues to discriminate their own lambs from others, and provide selective care to their own progeny (Brennan and Kendrick, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">2006</xref>). Mice, on the other hand, form communal nests and provide maternal care to own and alien pups. Nevertheless, mice are able to discriminate the odor of their pups from others (Ostermeyer and Elwood, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">1983</xref>), and they have been shown to form nests preferentially with related individuals (Manning et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">1992</xref>); moreover, the interaction with pups during the perinatal period seems essential for progeny recognition (Mak and Weiss, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">2010</xref>). Signatures that identify different individuals are proposed to be provided by candidate molecules such as MHC peptides (Boehm and Zufall, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">2006</xref>) or major urinary proteins (MUPs; Hurst, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">2009</xref>). While MHC peptides are detected by both the main and accessory olfactory systems, MUPs are thought to act through activation of the vomeronasal organ (Mor&#x000e8;, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">2006</xref>; Chamero et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">2007</xref>). Differences in MHC loci result in changes in the profile of peptides found in the urine (Singer et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">1997</xref>). Notably, mice can even discriminate pups that differ only in a single MHC locus (Penn and Potts, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">1998</xref>; Yamazaki et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B65">2000</xref>).</p><p>Given the importance of olfactory cues to both mate and offspring recognition, it is intriguing that pregnancy and lactation, interaction with pups, and exposure to potential mating partners are all accompanied by the addition of new neurons to the olfactory circuit. Because adult neurogenesis results in a new set of bulbar interneurons, thought to be more responsive than preexisting cells (Magavi et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">2005</xref>), and because interneurons are thought to play an important role in the discriminability of odors (Yokoi et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B66">1995</xref>; Abraham et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">2010</xref>), we hypothesized that the addition of newly generated neurons that are reaching maturity at the time of parturition could be important for the formation of the maternal bond and recognition of the progeny, both for providing maternal care and for avoiding inbreeding (Gandelman et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">1971</xref>; Barnard and Fitzsimons, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">1988</xref>; Potts et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">1991</xref>; Manning et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">1992</xref>; Pusey and Wolf, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">1996</xref>). Here, we sought to investigate the contribution of adult olfactory neurogenesis to both maternal behavior and pup recognition. Using focal irradiation of the SVZ, we disrupted adult bulbar neurogenesis in female mice. We then compared maternal behavior between irradiated and non-irradiated females by daily recording mother&#x02013;pup home cage interactions, and determining their maternal responsiveness in a retrieval test. To assess the contribution of new neurons to young and adult offspring recognition, we used habituation/dishabituation and social interaction tests. We show that disruption of bulbar neurogenesis resulted in abnormal social interaction patterns with adult males. By contrast, reduced olfactory neurogenesis neither affected maternal behavior nor the ability of female mice to discriminate between their own and alien pups. Thus, adult olfactory neurogenesis does not seem to be essential to the normal establishment or expression of maternal behavior, but our results point to a role of adult neurogenesis in social interaction, and possibly in gender discrimination.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s1"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec><title>Animals</title><p>C57BL/6J mice (Janvier, France) were used in this study.

Observations began the day when birth was detected (P0), and continued until postnatal day 8 (P8) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). The recorded behaviors were divided in two main categories, based on previous studies (Myers et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">1989</xref>): behaviors occurring at the nest, or outside the nest. Behavior at nest was further classified as: <italic>mother in a nursing posture</italic>, regardless of whether pups were attached to the nipples or not, and which could be either <italic>active</italic>&#x02009;&#x02013; the mother was arched over the pups in a position that could be considered to require some &#x0201c;effort,&#x0201d; i.e., with the abdomen actively elevated from the floor &#x02013; or <italic>passive</italic>&#x02009;&#x02013; lying on the pups or sideways &#x02013;; <italic>pups lactating</italic>, when at least half of the pups were attached to the nipples; mother <italic>licking or grooming the pups</italic>; mother <italic>self-grooming</italic>; mother performing <italic>nest maintenance</italic>; <italic>eating</italic> or <italic>resting</italic> (<bold>Figure A1B</bold> in Appendix illustrates some examples). The fraction of time (observations) that mice were engaged in each type of behavior was determined, and is expressed as the fraction of observed events of a given category relative to the total number of observations (30 in a 1-h session), or relative to the number of observations in which the female was at the nest (<italic>fraction of AT NEST time</italic>). Because maternal behavior is influenced by litter size (Lonstein and Fleming, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">2002</xref>), we culled litters to seven to eight pups per mother.</p></sec><sec><title>Retrieval test</title><p>Retrieval tests were conducted daily from P1 to P7 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>), using a protocol adapted from previous studies (Myers et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">1989</xref>; Lucas et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">1998</xref>; Lonstein and Fleming, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">2002</xref>). Tests took place in the afternoon (light phase), after the home cage observation session. Each day, cages were transferred to a test room, and pups were removed from the nest and kept warm by placing them on a heat pad. After 15&#x02009;min of separation from their mothers, four pups were put back at the end of the cage opposite to the nest. We recorded the latency of the female to retrieve each pup. It is important to note that mothers were at the nest at the moment when pups were reintroduced in the cage.</p></sec><sec><title>Discrimination of own vs. alien pups</title><p>To assess the ability of females to discriminate their own pups from alien pups (pups coming from a different litter), we used a protocol similar to the habituation/dishabituation paradigm but where pups served as stimuli (Ostermeyer and Elwood, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">1983</xref>). Two litters were removed from the cages and kept warm on a heat pad. Mothers were then left alone in the home cage for 15&#x02009;min. Pups were sequentially presented in 3-min sessions, separated by 3&#x02009;min of rest. The first four presentations consisted of pups belonging to the test female (O1&#x02013;O4, Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>); in the fifth presentation, a pup from a different litter (alien, A) was introduced. Lastly, a pup belonging to the test female was presented (O5). All presentations were video-recorded and analyzed offline. The <italic>investigation time</italic>, defined as the amount of time spent sniffing or licking, of each pup was determined. The habituation/dishabituation test was performed on day 11 after delivery (P11; Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref> and Supplementary Video).</p></sec><sec><title>Social interaction and offspring recognition</title><p>Female mice were subjected to three sessions of social recognition/interaction at different time points after weaning: 30 min, 3 weeks and 3 months after weaning of their pups. In all cases, the test was carried out in the home cage of the test female and each presentation lasted 3&#x02009;min. In the first session, we assessed the differential interaction of females with a juvenile (separated 30&#x02009;min before) male of their own litter compared to an alien juvenile male that were simultaneously introduced in the cage. In the other two sessions, mice coming from the test female's litter or from a different litter were introduced sequentially (in a balanced order) in sessions separated by a 4-min interval. In these latter seassions, both female and male mice were used as stimuli. All sessions were video-recorded and analyzed offline. Interaction was defined to include behaviors of the test mouse directed toward the stimulus mouse, including olfactory investigation, allogrooming, pursuit, and sitting in close proximity (Winslow, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B64">2003</xref>), and it was determined using a stopwatch. To control for differences in solicitation from the stimuli mice, we also determined their interaction directed toward experimental females (<bold>Figure A4</bold> in Appendix).</p></sec><sec><title>Urine collection</title><p>Urine was collected from four to five unrelated adult males and females by gently massaging the pelvic region. The urine was collected with a plastic pipette as soon as it was spontaneously voided above a glass Petri dish. Same-sex urine samples were subsequently pooled and stored at &#x02212;20&#x000b0;C until the experiment.</p></sec><sec><title>Object/odor investigation</title><p>Exploration of an odorless object, male urine, female urine, and a non-social odorant was evaluated at the end of the experiment, 7.5&#x02013;8&#x02009;months after irradiation. A marble (object), a marble scented with male urine (20 &#x003bc;l), a marble scented with female urine (20&#x02009;&#x003bc;l), and a marble scented with (-)-carvone (pure, 20 &#x003bc;l, Sigma) were used as stimuli. The different stimuli were presented on different days, and in the same order for each mouse. All tests were carried out in the home cage, and consisted of the presentation of the stimuli during 3&#x02009;min. Behavior was video-recorded and analyzed offline. The time spent investigating the stimulus was measured using a stopwatch.</p></sec><sec><title>Open field</title><p>Locomotor activity and anxiety-related behavior were evaluated in this paradigm, in 40-min sessions. Open field arenas were dark-gray plexiglass boxes measuring 40&#x02009;cm&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;40&#x02009;cm, and were placed in a well-lit room. Mouse activity was video-recorded, and <italic>x</italic>&#x02013;<italic>y</italic> position was extracted at a sampling rate of 5&#x02009;Hz using the mouse-tracking feature of QUIA software. For analysis, the arena was virtually divided in 16 equally sized squares. The four central quadrants were defined as the <italic>center</italic>, an area approximately 11&#x02009;cm away from all walls. Total traveled distance, number of quadrant crossings, time spent in the center (defined as the number of samples in the center divided by the total number of sampling points) and distance traveled in the center were determined. Distance was defined as the Euclidean distance between two sampling points and was calculated in relative units. Speed at each time point was calculated as distance/time.</p></sec><sec><title>Pup development</title><p>To assess the impact of variations in maternal care on pup development, a few measurements that relate to pup growth and development were determined. <italic>Body weight</italic> and <italic>tail length</italic> were recorded daily from P1 to P14, immediately after the pups were separated from their mothers in preparation for the retrieval test; pups were then left undisturbed until testing. <italic>Eye opening</italic> day was also recorded.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical analyses</title><p>Data are expressed as mean&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;SEM in bar graphs or time courses, unless otherwise stated. Boxplots represent median and interquartile ranges. Statistical analyses were performed using Statistica (StatSoft) or custom-written software (Matlab, MathWorks). Non-parametric tests were chosen when the data did not follow the assumptions for parametric tests. Density of DCX staining in control vs. irradiated brains was compared using a Mann&#x02013;Whitney <italic>U</italic> test. For observations at the home cage and retrieval test, two-way repeated measures ANOVA (rmANOVA) was used to compare behavior between treatments (control vs. irradiated), and evaluate changes of behavior across days. <italic>p</italic>-values for the age factor were corrected for violations of sphericity (correlations in the repeated measures) using the Greenhouse&#x02013;Geisser (G&#x02013;G) correction. For interaction with own vs. alien pups, two-way rmANOVA was used to evaluate differences between treatments and stimulus type. For all other behavioral tests, non-parametric tests were used for comparing unpaired (Mann&#x02013;Whitney or Wilcoxon unpaired) or paired samples (Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed-rank test) as described in the text or the corresponding figure legends. For pup weight and tail length, we used a two-way rmANOVA (with treatment and age as factors); for eye opening time, we used a Kolmogorov&#x02013;Smirnov test. Statistical significance was set at <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05.

To decrease the level of adult-born neurons reaching the OB, we selectively exposed the SVZ of female mice to gamma irradiation, while sparing other brain regions (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s1">Materials and Methods</xref> and Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>A; Lazarini et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">2009</xref>). The effect of this treatment on olfactory neurogenesis was corroborated in a subset of animals (Group A) 6.5&#x02009;months after irradiation by quantifying the expression of DCX. As previously shown (Lazarini et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">2009</xref>), SVZ irradiation resulted in a marked reduction of newly generated neurons in the OB (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>B,C; <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05, Mann&#x02013;Whitney <italic>U</italic> test, see <bold>Table A1</bold> in Appendix). DCX immunoreactivity in the rostral migratory stream of the OB (rmsOB) of irradiated females was 23% of that of control, non-irradiated females; overall, there was a 63% reduction of neurogenesis in the OB after irradiation.</p></sec><sec><title>Females with reduced OB neurogenesis spent more time at the nest</title><p>We compared the undisturbed, spontaneous maternal behavior at the home cage of irradiated and control females, from the day of pup birth (postnatal day 0, or P0; Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>) until postnatal day 8 (P8). Irradiated females spent significantly longer time at the nest compared to controls (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>A; <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.0196; see <bold>Table A1</bold> in Appendix). For both groups, the amount of time spent at the nest decreased as pups grew older (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.0096, rmANOVA); importantly, the time course of this decrease in control females resembled that observed in other studies (Kimchi et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">2007</xref>). The tendency of IRR females to stay longer at the nest was also evidenced by a decreased number of transitions in and out of the nest, as compared to CTRL females (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>B; <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.0222).

Retrieval behavior is an important component of maternal behavior, and retrieval tests have been widely used to evaluate it. Rodent models with altered maternal behavior show changes in the latency to retrieve pups to the nest, or in the time to complete the retrieval of all pups (Lucas et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">1998</xref>; Bridges et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">2001</xref>). We performed retrieval tests daily from days P1 to P7. Few females failed to retrieve their pups to the nest on the first day of testing, and the proportion of sessions with no retrievals did not differ between CTRL and IRR females (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>A; IRR: one out of nine, CTRL; one out of seven, <italic>p</italic> (&#x02009;0.05 two-sided difference of proportions test).

We hypothesized that the addition of newly generated neurons during pregnancy could play a role in aiding the learning and discrimination of pup odors. In the next set of experiments, we tested the ability of IRR females to discriminate pups, as well as their differential interaction with own vs. alien pups or young adults.</p><p>The ability of female mice to spontaneously discriminate pups was tested at P11 in a protocol analogous to a habituation/dishabituation test but using pups as stimuli (Ostermeyer and Elwood, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">1983</xref>). Pups belonging to the female's litter were introduced sequentially. In each presentation, females immediately retrieved the pup to the nest, and engaged in sniffing and licking the retrieved pup (see Supplementary Video). As observed in habituation protocols, investigation time decreased after the first presentation in CTRL females (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>; blue boxes, compare O1 and O2; <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.04, Wilcoxon matched-pairs test). These females were also able to discriminate between pups from their own or different litters, as evidenced by a large increase in investigation time when females were presented with an alien pup (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>; blue boxes, compare O4 and <italic>alien</italic>; <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.04, Wilcoxon matched-pairs test), as previously shown for outbred mice (Ostermeyer and Elwood, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">1983</xref>).

Females were exposed sequentially to both males and females from their litter (own) and unrelated litters (alien). As observed at weaning day, IRR females spent far more time in contact with the mice introduced, and this was true at both time points.

Neither CTRL nor IRR females showed differential interaction with own vs. alien juveniles (data not shown), and thus the data is pooled together; this is in contrast with a recent study where male mice were shown to investigate differentially own vs. alien progeny, a difference that was dependent on intact neurogenesis (Mak and Weiss, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">2010</xref>).</p><fig id="F9" position="float"><label>Figure 9</label><caption><p><bold>Increased social interaction persists at later times, and is the result of altered interaction with males</bold>.

Females with impaired neurogenesis showed abnormal social interaction patterns with male conspecifics when compared to controls. When maternal behavior was evaluated, we observed that the reduction of olfactory neurogenesis had little effect on the behaviors analyzed. We further hypothesized that adult neurogenesis contributes to fine odor discrimination, and could therefore be important for pup recognition. Disruption of bulbar neurogenesis in female mice, however, did not affect their ability to discriminate their own pups from others. Thus, the addition of neurons in the olfactory system was not required for the establishment and expression of maternal behavior or pup discrimination, but rather played a role in social interaction.</p><sec><title>Maternal behavior was largely unaffected in females with impaired neurogenesis</title><p>A growing number of studies shows that the levels of neurogenesis are modulated in the context of reproductive and social behavior, providing a framework for studying neurogenesis in ethologically relevant situations (Shingo et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">2003</xref>; Mak et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">2007</xref>; Larsen et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">2008</xref>; Mak and Weiss, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">2010</xref>).</p><p>Based on those studies, it has been hypothesized that adult-generated neurons in the olfactory system could play a role in parental behavior. To investigate whether a direct causal link between neurogenesis and maternal behavior exists, we evaluated the effect of reducing OB adult neurogenesis on several aspects of maternal behavior. Similarly, a recent study examined how maternal behavior is affected when surges of PRL, together with the concomitant increase in neurogenesis, are blocked during pregnancy (Larsen and Grattan, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">2010</xref>). As in our study, the authors reported no difference in a retrieval test between low-PRL (i.e., low neurogenesis) and control females when the mothers were tested in their home cage. Our results extend these findings by showing that irradiation of the SVZ (a manipulation that specifically disrupts proliferation of neuronal progenitors) of female mice not only does not lead to deficits in pup retrieval, but also leaves overall maternal care unaffected.</p><p>The only difference we observed in irradiated mice was an increase in the time irradiated females spent at the nest with their litters. This observation is intriguing, as it does not seem to arise due to a lack of exploration or increased anxiety. It is possible that irradiated mice are less &#x0201c;interested&#x0201d; in exploring the environment due to an olfactory deficit, or that they are less sensitive to food odors and therefore less motivated to leave the nest; however, this seems unlikely given that both irradiated and control mice showed similar levels of odor exploration (as observed in the marble and habituation/dishabituation tests).</p><p>Altogether, disruption of olfactory neurogenesis had little effect on maternal behavior, at least for the behaviors evaluated. These observations could be explained by the fact that the behaviors tested are primarily related to motivational aspects of maternal care, and not necessarily require olfactory neurogenesis, although OB function is important for the normal establishment of maternal behavior in primiparous female mice (Gandelman et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">1971</xref>). Alternatively, it is possible that the absence of a strong effect is related to limitations of the manipulation used. Although the irradiation protocol used has the important advantage of being highly focal, which allowed us to target the SVZ without affecting the hippocampus (Lazarini et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">2009</xref>), a potential caveat of this method is its chronic nature: olfactory neurogenesis is reduced chronically, which could result in the appearance of compensatory mechanisms. In addition, despite the fact that the levels of neurogenesis were drastically reduced in irradiated females, it is possible that the remaining neurogenesis was sufficient to sustain normal behavior.</p></sec><sec><title>Discrimination of social odors</title><p>Upon birth, mothers are exposed for the first time to the odor of their offspring. Ewes, for instance, learn the odor of their lambs during the first hours after birth, and provide selective care to their progeny, rejecting others (Brennan and Kendrick, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">2006</xref>). Female mice, despite forming communal nests and caring for own and alien pups, nest preferentially with other closely related females (Manning et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">1992</xref>). We hypothesized that learning and discriminating the odors of a female's own pups from pups coming from different litters could be important, at least in the wild. We further hypothesized that the addition of newly generated neurons during pregnancy could play a role in aiding the learning and discrimination of pup odors, and thus contribute to the recognition of a female's own progeny. Indeed, a recent study shows that interaction with pups results in an increase of neurogenesis in male mice (Mak and Weiss, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">2010</xref>), and that increase seems to be important for pup recognition by fathers.</p><p>However, we show here that the ability of female mice to discriminate their pups from alien pups did not depend on intact levels of olfactory neurogenesis, as irradiated females preserved their discrimination capacity. Because neurogenesis was not completely ablated using our irradiation protocol it is possible that the remaining fraction of newly generated neurons arriving at the OB could suffice to perform this discrimination. Alternatively, and although discrimination of individuals is believed to be mediated by olfactory cues (Hurst et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">2001</xref>; Brennan and Kendrick, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">2006</xref>), females could use other cues to discriminate pups, such as ultrasound vocalizations, although this seems unlikely. Ultrasound calls emitted by pups when removed from the nest did not differ qualitatively among litters (data not shown), arguing against a contribution of these signals to pup discrimination. Moreover, this mouse strain suffers from age-related hearing loss (Nemoto et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">2004</xref>).</p><p>Social recognition studies suggest that there exist two types of discriminations: the fine discrimination of individuals within a strain, and the coarser discrimination of individuals belonging to different strains and thus genetically diverse (Macbeth et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">2009b</xref>). It is important to note that here we used genetically identical mice, and therefore tested the discrimination within a strain, and showed that the ability of irradiated females to perform such a fine discrimination remained intact. However, we cannot rule out that irradiation could have affected the ability of mice to discriminate across strains. Although this discrimination seems at first glance an easier one, it is possible that irradiation compromised specifically the ability to discriminate among the genetically varying molecular profiles, such as those determined by MHC molecules or MUPs (Singer et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">1997</xref>; Hurst, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">2009</xref>), leaving odor discrimination intact. Intra and inter-strain discrimination could also rely on different neuronal circuits, which could have been differentially affected by our irradiation protocol.</p><p>Recognition of individuals and mating preferences are assessed behaviorally as a differential investigation of conspecifics (Barnard and Fitzsimons, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">1988</xref>; Krackow and Matuschak, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">1991</xref>; Macbeth et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">2009a</xref>). Despite being able to discriminate their pups from others, females did not show a differential interaction with alien compared to own pups or juveniles when tested in a social interaction assay. This was true both for irradiated and control females. Although one would expect, in the light of inbreeding avoidance (Pusey and Wolf, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">1996</xref>; Sherborne et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">2007</xref>), that females would show some preference in the interaction with related vs. unrelated individuals, the lack of such a difference in our interaction test does not imply that, given the choice, female mice would mate indiscriminately with either male mouse. This remains an open question, as we did not test mating preferences, and the interaction test may be insufficient to uncover those. It is also possible that differences in social behavior would have been evident if we used wild-derived or outbred mice. Our results are in contrast with a recent study (Mak et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">2007</xref>) that shows that male mice exposed to their pups are able to recognize their progeny later in adulthood, a recognition that is PRL-dependent and correlated with an increase in neurogenesis. The difference with our study could arise from differences in paternal vs. maternal interaction with progeny.</p><p>Remarkably, irradiated females spent more time engaged in social interaction, independently of the identity of the individual introduced. This increased investigation could be interpreted as irradiated females requiring longer investigation time to process information about the subject's identity. However, this cannot be attributed to a general increase in exploration of odor stimuli (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">10</xref>). A possible caveat of this last experiment is that testing was done last in the series of behavioral experiments, at a point (7.5&#x02013;8&#x02009;months after IRR, that is, 9.5&#x02013;10&#x02009;months of age) where the difference in neurogenesis between CTRL and IRR could be lower due to the age-related decline of neurogenesis (Luo et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">2006</xref>). However, our result is consistent with other studies that show that object investigation and recognition is unaffected in mice with ablated neurogenesis (Breton-Provencher et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">2009</xref>). The increased interaction that we observed in females with reduced neurogenesis is in contrast with manipulations that render mice anosmic; such manipulations result in decreased investigation of opposite-sex conspecifics (Yoon et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B67">2005</xref>) or odorants (Keller et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">2006</xref>).</p><p>One interesting observation when comparing social interaction 3 weeks and 3&#x02009;months after weaning was that control animals maintained an elevated interaction with female &#x0201c;intruders&#x0201d; but reduced their interaction with males. It is important to note that 3 weeks after weaning mice are still considered juveniles and are still sexually immature, whereas 3&#x02009;months after weaning male mice have become fully mature and therefore constitute potential mates. Thus, as expected, control females develop a differential interaction with male or female stimuli when the stimuli are sexually mature subjects. However, the pattern observed in control females was altered in irradiated females, who spent similar amounts of time interacting with male and female conspecifics, suggesting that the processing of male odors involved in mate recognition is impaired in irradiated females (Hurst, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">2009</xref>). In a previous study (Lazarini et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">2009</xref>), some of us reported that SVZ-irradiated and control males spent a similar amount of time investigating male conspecifics; however, the interaction of male mice with females was not evaluated. In the present study, irradiated females showed an altered pattern of interaction with male conspecifics, but not with conspecifics of their same sex. Thus, it would be interesting to explore whether the deficits observed in the interaction are restricted to opposite-sex interactions, or is a deficit specific to female mice.</p><p>Notably, irradiated and control females did not differ in the investigation of urine from male conspecifics (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">10</xref>). This suggests that the differences observed in the interaction are likely to arise due to deficits in the detection or discrimination of social cues not present in urine, and points to the importance of other signals, and perhaps sensory modalities, available to the mice when interacting with the whole animal. Alternatively, some relevant volatile components in the urine could have been lost, although this seems unlikely as we froze the urine immediately after collection. Several substances have been implicated in mediating sex recognition and opposite-sex attraction in mice, acting on both the main and accessory olfactory systems (Ramm et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">2008</xref>). Although most of the components characterized so far are present in the urine (Lin et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">2005</xref>; Baum and Kelliher, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">2009</xref>), other social cues important for sex recognition and sexual interaction are found in other body secretions, such as those from the lachrymal and submaxillary glands (Kimoto et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">2005</xref>; Haga et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">2010</xref>).</p><p>By ruling out differences in the investigation of urine (the marble-urine test) our observations narrow down the possible factors that could be involved in the differential interaction with males observed in irradiated females. Thus, it would be interesting to test whether newly generated neurons are responsive to candidate pheromones, and whether fewer neurons respond to this molecule in irradiated females. Although our results do not provide conclusive evidence for a deficit in gender discrimination in irradiated females, they are consistent with this hypothesis, and they point to this as an intriguing line for future experiments. Such an impairment in the processing of male-related odors could have consequences for the recognition of potential mating partners, and therefore for reproductive behavior. Further experiments are required, however, to explain the interaction pattern observed in irradiated females and elucidate the underlying mechanism.</p></sec><sec><title>Disruption of the OB network: fewer plastic cells or altered selection?</title><p>What is the effect of irradiation on the OB network? Both in this study in female mice, and in a previous study from our laboratory using male mice (Lazarini et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">2009</xref>), we showed that SVZ irradiation results in a substantial reduction of young (DCX+) neurons reaching the OB. Because DCX is expressed transiently in immature neurons, determining DCX levels provides only a snapshot of the population of newly born neurons arriving in the OB. However, an important component of adult neurogenesis is the selection, integration and survival of adult-generated neurons (Lledo et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">2006</xref>). In our previous study (Lazarini et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">2009</xref>), we observed that the adult-generated neurons that did reach the OB in irradiated animals did not undergo the selection/survival process that normally occurs in control animals. In this scenario, the behavioral consequences that result from SVZ irradiation could be due to the lack of a population of neurons with specific properties (young, more plastic neurons; Nissant et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">2009</xref>), or to the lack of selective pressure on the neurons that arrive in the bulb, or both. Further experiments are required to distinguish between these different hypotheses. In either case, we show here that disruption of normal adult neurogenesis in female mice results in altered social behavior.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Several lines of evidence have suggested a link between olfactory neurogenesis and maternal behavior. However, our experiments show that reduction of adult neurogenesis neither affects the establishment and expression of maternal behavior &#x02013; to the extent of the parameters analyzed &#x02013; nor does it compromise the ability of female mice to distinguish among pups. Rather, adult olfactory neurogenesis is important for normal social interaction. Our results suggest a possible role of adult neurogenesis in sex recognition, consistent with previous studies implicating neurogenesis in mate preference (Mak et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">2007</xref>), and opens up new ends to tackle the contribution of adult neurogenesis to reproductive behavior.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Conflict of Interest Statement</title><p>The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interest.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We wish to thank Drs.
