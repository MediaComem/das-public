The event built on the success of the NATA-founded Youth Sports Safety Alliance and its prior summits. The Alliance, comprising nearly 150 organizations, is committed to preventing catastrophic injury and illness in youth athletes. The program culminated with visits to legislators on Capitol Hill on March 11. As a result of the National Action Plan for Sports Safety introduced at last year&#x02019;s Summit, Congress introduced House Resolution 72 (H. Res. 72), the Secondary School Student Athletes&#x02019; Bill of Rights. It addresses the important rights of young athletes when participating in secondary school sports programs. The plan is an educational initiative to improve sports safety, achieve appropriate medical care in secondary schools, understand the potential risks, and at the same time, bring to light the many benefits of playing sports. Recently, a companion bill has been introduced in the Senate. S. Res. 372 hopes to accomplish the same goals as the House version. Summit topics ranged from risk management for administrators to new research and recommendations on high school sports safety, including concussions, preparticipation exams, mental health and the athlete, and highlights of a new benchmark study that addressed appropriate medical care in today&#x02019;s secondary school setting. Afternoon discussions included athletic administration, as well as best practices in awareness and training; on the field; and advocacy.</p></sec></body></article>
