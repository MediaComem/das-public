The dependent variables needed to include kinematic or kinetic data during running, such as ground reaction forces (GRFs), shock attenuation, joint angles, joint moments, or powers. Studies that focused solely on metabolic factors, such as aerobic demand and oxygen uptake or running economy, were excluded, as well as those that assessed walking, stationary running, or incline running.</p><p>Two authors (AGS and JMK) independently screened titles and abstracts of the studies retrieved. If no abstract was available or uncertainty existed, full-text articles were retrieved. Reference lists of included articles were checked for additional studies.

Many of the study participants were described as &#x0201c;active,&#x0201d; not necessarily indicating that their main sport was running. Other articles that specified the participants as &#x0201c;runners&#x0201d; did not specify average mileage per week of training or had varying mileage per week of training ranging from 16 to 135 km (roughly 10-84 miles) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1941738113508544">Table 1</xref>).</p><p>Possible differences in running mechanics between ground and treadmill running should also be considered a limitation, and the articles included were nearly split in this regard. Although proper measures were taken to effectively ensure that running velocity was controlled, there may be opportunity for participants to modify running mechanics slightly if a true steady state was not reached. The short duration of the test condition could perhaps also affect the pattern observed during the studies.</p><p>Another potential limitation is the constant speed used. Some studies allowed runners to self-select speed and then calculated preferred stride frequency at that speed.<sup><xref rid="bibr8-1941738113508544" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="bibr9-1941738113508544" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> Other studies specifically chose a fixed speed and manipulated stride frequency based on preferred stride frequency at that speed.<sup><xref rid="bibr2-1941738113508544" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="bibr3-1941738113508544" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="bibr7-1941738113508544" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="bibr10-1941738113508544" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="bibr12-1941738113508544" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="bibr13-1941738113508544" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="bibr15-1941738113508544" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> The preselected speed in these studies may have altered the kinematics and kinetics, even at the preferred cadence, for runners in studies where it was not clearly stated what their prior volume, intensity, and speed of training was or whether they were experienced runners. One common concern was that runners had limited exposure running at the manipulated stride rates; therefore, it is unclear whether the kinematic and kinetic changes observed would change after extensive training with the altered cadence. Only immediate changes were reported.</p><p>Although limitations may include running surface and speed, these should not affect the validity of the findings, as there is still a comparison between the different step rate and length conditions. In addition, narrowing a search with more stringent inclusion criteria (eg, running surface or speed) would have further limited the number of articles included.</p><p>Changes in technology over time likely contributed to differences observed. Several studies employed a 2-dimensional analysis to assess running kinematics,<sup><xref rid="bibr2-1941738113508544" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="bibr16-1941738113508544" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> whereas more recent studies used a 3-dimensional approach.<sup><xref rid="bibr9-1941738113508544" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="bibr15-1941738113508544" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup></p><p>None of the articles included in this systematic review specifically addressed injury prevention or recovery. Outcome data involved biomechanical changes, including kinematic and kinetic data, in a healthy population. Therefore, the external validity of the findings remains unknown.</p></sec><sec id="section22-1941738113508544"><title>Clinical Relevance</title><p>A clinician may consider gait manipulation in a symptomatic patient who is having pain with running; pain may be used as an outcome measure to help determine whether the biomechanical changes are contributing to the patient&#x02019;s symptoms. If the runner is symptomatic, the response to a change in gait may be immediate and provide a basis to judge effectiveness. Auditory cueing with the use of a metronome was most commonly used for feedback. In the clinical setting, minimal time for motor change and carryover effect must be considered, as studies have not reassessed mechanics beyond the immediate timeframe. In addition to practice, motor learning is influenced by the type and timing of feedback provided, which should vary as a patient progresses through phases of motor learning (skill acquisition vs skill refinement vs skill retention).<sup><xref rid="bibr6-1941738113508544" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="bibr11-1941738113508544" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="bibr17-1941738113508544" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="bibr22-1941738113508544" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup></p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="section23-1941738113508544"><title>Conclusion</title><p>The findings suggest that increased stride rate (decreased stride length) affects impact peak, kinematics, and kinetics and therefore may be considered as a mechanism with which to influence injury risk and recovery of a runner. Specifically, similarities are seen across all studies, with decreased center of mass vertical excursion, GRF, impact shock and attenuation, and energy absorbed at the hip, knee, and ankle as step rate is increased or step length is decreased at a constant speed. Furthermore, some studies showed changes in axial reaction forces at the lumbar spine<sup><xref rid="bibr15-1941738113508544" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> and angular velocity differences between the knee and rearfoot.<sup><xref rid="bibr16-1941738113508544" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> The minimum change in step frequency required to observe biomechanical change was 10% in most cases<sup><xref rid="bibr2-1941738113508544" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="bibr3-1941738113508544" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="bibr8-1941738113508544" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="bibr9-1941738113508544" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="bibr12-1941738113508544" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="bibr13-1941738113508544" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup>; however, changes were noted with as little as a 5% increase in step rate.<sup><xref rid="bibr2-1941738113508544" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="bibr9-1941738113508544" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup></p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="conflict"><p>The authors reported no potential conflicts of interest in the development and publication of this manuscript.</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="bibr1-1941738113508544"><label>1.</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal">
