Thirty-one collegiate swimmers from the university participated in this study. The subject mean age, height, and mass were 20 &#x000b1; 1.41 years, 179.17 &#x000b1; 9.65 cm, and 75.43 &#x000b1; 8.64 kg, respectively. On average, participants had swum competitively for 11.3 &#x000b1; 3.49 years. Subjects were included in the study if they were between 18 and 24 years of age, were regularly training at least 5 times per week for 1 to 2 hours each practice session, had at least 5 years of competitive swimming experience, and were completing practice with no restrictions at the time of the filming. Although subjects were not evaluated for previous shoulder injury or pain, individuals were excluded if they were unable to complete practices fully due to pain, injury, or illness at the time of the testing session. Because right and left shoulders were treated independently, biomechanical errors were evaluated for a total of 62 shoulders.</p><p>Each swimmer was instructed to swim freestyle for 1 length of the swimming pool at a pace 50% to 75% of his or her maximum race speed using his or her natural stroke technique. This was completed twice, resulting in a total of 50 yards swum by each subject. Swimmers were recorded for 2 trials while swimming freestyle to capture both the right and left sides of the athlete. One underwater camera and 1 above-water camera were placed at the end of a 25-yard swimming pool to obtain frontal views of each swimmer&#x02019;s freestyle biomechanics. The lateral view was obtained from both the underwater and above-water cameras. Both lateral camera views were adjusted to capture the last 15 yards of the pool. Each of the 4 views was uploaded into Dartfish video processing software (Fribourg, Switzerland), which was used to sync the frontal and lateral views to ensure that the same stroke and point in the stroke cycle were being evaluated.</p><p>Following the filming of all trials, a stroke cycle was selected for grading. A stroke cycle was considered appropriate for analysis if (1) the cycle was completely within the camera view, (2) the above-water and underwater cameras captured the subject sufficiently well so that his or her body was positioned at the center of each field throughout filming, and (3) the image size of the subject projected on the monitor was large enough to be viewed.<sup><xref rid="bibr15-1941738114527056" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> The first full stroke cycle to enter the camera view and meet the previous criteria was selected for evaluation.</p><p>Two experienced swimming coaches and 1 certified athletic trainer with experience with a collegiate-level swimming team and no knowledge of the swimmers&#x02019; shoulder injury histories or freestyle strokes were asked to observe and evaluate the selected video clips. All examiners underwent standardized training through the use of still photographs of the 7 biomechanical parameters and sample video examples of correct and incorrect freestyle biomechanics. This served as a practice evaluation before the actual test trial videos (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1941738114527056">Table 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1941738114527056">Figures 2</xref><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1941738114527056"/><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1941738114527056"/><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1941738114527056"/><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-1941738114527056"/><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-1941738114527056"/>-<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-1941738114527056">8</xref>). Each of the 7 parameters was graded as a yes or no for displaying the associated error. A majority-rules method was used in which the most common response among the 3 observers was chosen for each biomechanical parameter. Interrater reliability was established for the errors. Kappa scores for a dropped elbow during the pull-through phase and the recovery phase, an eyes-forward head-carrying angle, incorrect hand position during hand entry, incorrect hand entry angle, and an incorrect pull-through pattern had moderate to substantial agreement (range, 0.50-0.90) and were included in the analysis.

Dropping the elbow during the pull-through phase places the propulsive muscles of the shoulder at a mechanical disadvantage by placing the shoulder in a more externally rotated position.<sup><xref rid="bibr7-1941738114527056" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> This stroke error is commonly identified by swimming coaches and can result in shoulder external rotation with horizontal adduction, placing the shoulder in an impingement position.<sup><xref rid="bibr15-1941738114527056" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup></p><p>During the above-water recovery phase, the elbow should be kept higher than the wrist and should avoid a dropped position.<sup><xref rid="bibr2-1941738114527056" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="bibr14-1941738114527056" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> A dropped elbow during this phase may orient the humerus more perpendicular to the water, producing a shorter arc of motion and decreasing time spent in the impinged position.<sup><xref rid="bibr8-1941738114527056" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> This stroke alteration is incorrect, but it may be an attempt to avoid the impingement position of shoulder flexion and internal rotation.<sup><xref rid="bibr8-1941738114527056" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> This error could be the consequence of pain and not the cause. An elbow that enters prior to the hand causes the water to exert an upward force on the dropped humerus, leading to superior translation of the humeral head and subacromial impingement.<sup><xref rid="bibr14-1941738114527056" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup></p><p>The results indicate a relationship between dropped elbow during the recovery phase and a thumb-first hand entry angle as well as between a dropped elbow during recovery and an incorrect hand entry position. These findings suggest that a dropped elbow may lead to an improper entry position with the elbow entering before the hand.<sup><xref rid="bibr14-1941738114527056" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup></p><p>The mechanics of these swimmers may be a result of instruction provided by their youth swimming coaches or a stroke technique developed throughout their careers. These findings highlight the importance of proper instruction on stroke technique in youth swimming. The swimming motion is complex, and faulty mechanics may develop because of poor coaching, poor understanding by the swimmer, shoulder pain, or performance factors.</p><p>During video grading, the swimming coach evaluators identified a discrepancy between the provided criteria and a poor freestyle stroke technique. While maintaining a &#x0201c;straight back&#x0201d; pull-through during freestyle is considered safest for a swimmer&#x02019;s shoulder girdle because it avoids excessive horizontal adduction, coaches recognize an S-shaped pull-through pattern (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1941738114527056">Figure 5b</xref>) produces performance gains and increased swimming velocity.<sup><xref rid="bibr9-1941738114527056" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> Utilizing a curvilinear motion during the freestyle pull-through best produces propulsion by constantly pushing water and gaining additional resistance rather than by pushing water, which has already been accelerated by a straight back stroke path.<sup><xref rid="bibr2-1941738114527056" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> While this method of underwater propulsion makes sense for performance purposes, it yields increased risk for the swimmer&#x02019;s shoulder in a vulnerable impingement position. This curvilinear motion mimics the faulty S-shaped pull-through pattern, which can give rise to increased time in the impingement position. It forces the shoulder to maintain increased muscle recruitment and higher loads over a longer period.<sup><xref rid="bibr2-1941738114527056" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="bibr4-1941738114527056" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="bibr9-1941738114527056" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="bibr14-1941738114527056" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="bibr15-1941738114527056" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup></p><p>There are limitations to this research. First, the participants were all members of the same collegiate team, which may affect the generalizability. Although all subjects were members of the same collegiate team, they had trained across the country and came from a variety of training clubs. In addition, our sample was limited to the number of healthy subjects currently on the team. Thus, some of the associations were nonsignificant because of the smaller sample size. Finally, each shoulder of the swimmer was treated as independent, with stroke evaluation and pain scores evaluated on the right and the left shoulder independently for the analysis. Paired shoulders were treated independently to understand how stroke biomechanics relate to the development of pain on the ipsilateral shoulder.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="section12-1941738114527056"><title>Conclusion</title><p>It is crucial that both coaches and medical professionals recognize faulty biomechanics in swimming freestyle.
