We demonstrate that T<sub>reg</sub> progenitors highly express the TNFRSF members GITR, OX40, and TNFR2. Expression of these receptors correlates directly with T cell receptor (TCR) signal strength, and requires CD28 and the kinase TAK1. Neutralizing TNFSF ligands markedly reduced T<sub>reg</sub> development. Conversely, TNFRSF agonists enhanced T<sub>reg</sub> differentiation by augmenting IL-2R/STAT5 responsiveness. GITR-ligand costimulation elicited a dose-dependent enrichment of lower-affinity cells within the T<sub>reg</sub> repertoire. <italic>In vivo</italic>, combined inhibition of GITR, OX40 and TNFR2 abrogated T<sub>reg</sub> development. Thus TNFRSF expression on T<sub>reg</sub> progenitors translates strong TCR signals into molecular parameters that specifically promote T<sub>reg</sub> differentiation and shape the T<sub>reg</sub> repertoire.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p id="P2">The development of T lymphocytes with randomly generated T cell receptors (TCRs) allows for diverse and productive immune responses, but also raises the risk for autoimmunity. The thymic medulla contains antigen presenting cells (APCs) that display self-peptide:major histocompatibility (MHC) complexes to immature CD4 and CD8 single positive (SP) thymocytes, and plays a critical role in limiting autoimmunity<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup>. This occurs in part by deletion of a substantial fraction of autoreactive thymocytes via the process of negative selection. However, some autoreactive T cells escape deletion in the thymus, and thus alternative mechanisms to control autoreactivity have evolved including the production of thymic-derived regulatory T cells (T<sub>reg</sub>)<sup><xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup>. The transcription factor Foxp3 plays a critical role in this process as inactivating mutations in <italic>Foxp3 </italic>abrogate T<sub>reg</sub> development and cause lethal multi-organ lymphoproliferative disease<sup><xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup>.

T<sub>reg</sub> development occurs via a multistep differentiation process that preferentially drives high affinity autoreactive T cells to express <italic>Foxp3</italic>. A key question is how thymocytes translate relative differences in TCR signal strength into distinct developmental programs that give rise to na&#x000ef;ve CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells or regulatory T cells, respectively.</p><p id="P3">Thymic T<sub>reg</sub> development occurs via a two-step process<sup><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup>. An initial TCR-CD28-driven signaling event leads to expression of CD25 and CD122 (the &#x003b1; and &#x003b2; subunits of the IL-2 receptor) and c-REL-dependent chromatin remodeling at the <italic>Foxp3 </italic>locus<sup><xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>-<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup>. A second, TCR-independent but cytokine-dependent step occurs when CD25<sup>+</sup>Foxp3<sup>&#x02212;</sup> T<sub>reg</sub> progenitors receive an IL-2 signal, which via a STAT5-dependent process drives <italic>Foxp3</italic> expression to complete the Treg differentiation process<sup><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P4">How high affinity TCR stimuli drive a molecular program that results in T<sub>reg</sub> differentiation remains poorly defined. A hallmark of T<sub>reg</sub> progenitor cells that might play a role in this process is their high expression of the TNFRSF member TNFRSF18, (called GITR hereafter). As GITR expression precedes the induction of Foxp3 in developing T<sub>reg</sub> cells, we hypothesized that costimulation via GITR may support conversion of T<sub>reg</sub> progenitors into mature Foxp3<sup>+</sup> T<sub>reg</sub> cells in the thymus.</p><p id="P5">In addition to GITR, several other TNFRSF members are expressed on T<sub>reg</sub> cells<sup><xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup>. We screened thymocytes by flow cytometry and found that GITR, TNFRSF4 (called OX40 herafter), and TNFRSF1B (called TNFR2 hereafter) are uniquely overexpressed on T<sub>reg</sub> progenitors when compared to conventional CD4SP thymocytes. Multiple APCs including dendritic cell subsets and medullary thymic epithelial cells express the corresponding ligands GITR-L, OX40-L, and TNF. We found that TNFRSF expression by T<sub>reg</sub> progenitors strongly correlates with TCR signal strength. Thus, CD4SP thymocytes encountering the highest affinity TCR signals most strongly upregulate GITR, OX40 and TNFR2. This process occurred via a TAK1-and CD28-dependent pathway as TAK1- and CD28-deficient T<sub>reg</sub> progenitors fail to express GITR, OX40, and TNFR2 and do not convert into mature Foxp3<sup>+</sup> T<sub>reg</sub> cells. Stimulation of wild type T<sub>reg</sub> progenitors with either GITR-L or OX40-L promoted their conversion into mature Foxp3<sup>+</sup> T<sub>reg</sub> cells at much lower doses of IL-2. In contrast, the addition of neutralizing antibodies to TNFSF members in neonatal thymic organ cultures markedly inhibited T<sub>reg</sub> development. Likewise, blocking signaling collectively through OX40, TNFR2 and GITR completely abrogated T<sub>reg</sub> development <italic>in vivo</italic> indicating that GITR, OX40 and TNFR2 function in a cell-intrinsic manner to program T<sub>reg</sub> differentiation. Finally, competition for TNFRSF costimulation skews the T<sub>reg</sub> repertoire toward higher affinity TCRs, as increasing GITR-L availability dose-dependently broadens the T<sub>reg</sub> repertoire by enriching for cells with reduced TCR signal strength. These findings support a model in which high-affinity TCR signals in CD4SP thymocytes are translated into a molecular program that entrains T<sub>reg</sub> development via increased expression of specific TNFRSF members. Ligation of GITR, OX40 or TNFR2 on T<sub>reg</sub> progenitors enhances the ability of T<sub>reg</sub> progenitors to compete for limiting amounts of IL-2 and thereby helps define the developmental niche for T<sub>reg</sub> cells in the thymus.</p><sec sec-type="results" id="S2"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>T<sub>reg</sub> progenitors highly express GITR, OX40 and TNFR2</title><p id="P6">A prominent feature of T<sub>reg</sub> progenitors is their high-level expression of GITR, which is upregulated prior to Foxp3 during T<sub>reg</sub> development (refs 8, 9 and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a</xref>). Studies to elucidate a role for GITR in T<sub>reg</sub> cells have primarily focused on the effects of costimulation on mature T<sub>reg</sub> cells in peripheral lymphoid organs<sup><xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>-<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup>. However, whether GITR costimulation plays any role during thymic T<sub>reg</sub> development is unknown. Because of the large potential for redundancy within the TNFRSF, we sought to clarify which of these receptors are expressed during T<sub>reg</sub> development. Staining Foxp3-GFP thymocytes with specific antibodies to evaluate expression by conventional (non-T<sub>reg</sub>) CD4SP thymocytes, T<sub>reg</sub> progenitors, and mature T<sub>reg</sub> cells (gated as CD4<sup>+</sup>CD8<sup>&#x02212;</sup>CD25<sup>&#x02212;</sup>Foxp3<sup>&#x02212;</sup>, CD4<sup>+</sup>CD8<sup>&#x02212;</sup>CD25<sup>+</sup>Foxp3<sup>&#x02212;</sup>, and CD4<sup>+</sup>CD8<sup>&#x02212;</sup>CD25<sup>+</sup>Foxp3<sup>+</sup>, respectively) revealed that in addition to GITR, T<sub>reg</sub> progenitors also highly express OX40 and TNFR2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a</xref>). Mature Foxp3<sup>+</sup> T<sub>reg</sub> cells continue to express high amounts of these TNFRSF members in the thymus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a</xref>) and in peripheral lymphoid organs (data not shown). T<sub>reg</sub> progenitors do not globally overexpress TNFRSF members, as 4-1BB, CD30, and TNFR1 were not detectable above background in thymic T<sub>reg</sub> progenitors or T<sub>reg</sub> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a</xref> and data not shown). CD27, which is already expressed on DP thymocytes, is highly expressed by all CD4SP thymocytes but was not further upregulated by T<sub>reg</sub> progenitors or mature Foxp3<sup>+</sup> T<sub>reg</sub> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 1</xref>). Thus, GITR, OX40, and TNFR2 are highly upregulated on T<sub>reg</sub> progenitors during thymic T<sub>reg</sub> development.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>APCs in the thymic medulla express GITR-L, OX40-L and TNF</title><p id="P7">For signaling, homotrimeric TNFRSF members require ligation by specific TNFSF ligands<sup><xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup>. Various APC subsets have been described to express TNFSF ligands upon activation in secondary lymphoid organs, but the constitutive expression of GITR-L, OX40-L, and TNF within the thymic APC subsets that actually mediate T<sub>reg</sub> differentiation has not been defined. Medullary thymic epithelial cells (mTEC; CD45<sup>&#x02212;</sup>EpCAM<sup>+</sup>UEA1<sup>+</sup>BP-1<sup>lo</sup>) constitutively express GITR-L, OX40-L, and TNF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1b</xref>). Both GITR-L and TNF are expressed by CD8&#x003b1;<sup>+</sup> and SIRP&#x003b1;<sup>+</sup> conventional DC subsets (CD11C<sup>+</sup>B220<sup>&#x02212;</sup>), and by plasmacytoid DCs (CD11C<sup>+</sup>B220<sup>+</sup>), whereas OX40-L expression is restricted to mTEC. Since TNFR2 can bind both membrane-bound and soluble TNF <sup><xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup>, we evaluated TNF expression by surface staining and by intracellular staining after fixation and permeabilization. We were able to detect membrane bound TNF on DCs (data not shown) albeit at much lower levels than total TNF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1b</xref>).</p><p id="P8">We used immunofluorescence microscopy to define the pattern of TNFSF ligand expression within the thymic microenvironment. Co-staining slides with anti-Keratin 5, which marks the thymic medulla (the location of thymic T<sub>reg</sub> differentiation), showed a high degree of overlap with OX40-L expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1c</xref>). Similar results were obtained when staining for GITR-L and TNF (data not shown). Thus, the specific ligands that bind the TNFRSF members present on developing T<sub>reg</sub> cells are expressed by APCs at the site of thymic T<sub>reg</sub> maturation.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>GITR, OX40 and TNFR2 correlate with TCR signal strength</title><p id="P9">When we gated on T<sub>reg</sub> progenitors and plotted the expression of GITR versus OX40 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a</xref>) or GITR versus TNFR2 (data not shown), we found that cells expressing the most GITR also express the most OX40 and TNFR2, and vice versa. This finding prompted us to ask the question if TNFRSF expression is related to TCR signal strength in T<sub>reg</sub> progenitors. For these experiments, we used Nur77-GFP BAC reporter mice, which provide a reliable readout of TCR signal strength via GFP expression<sup><xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup>. We found a significant positive correlation between Nur77-GFP fluorescence and GITR, OX40 and TNFR2 expression in T<sub>reg</sub> progenitors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a,b</xref>). In contrast, expression of CD27, a TNFRSF member recently reported to drive thymic Treg development via the inhibition of apoptosis<sup><xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup>, did not correlate significantly with Nur77-GFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b</xref>). Therefore, thymic T<sub>reg</sub> progenitors receiving the strongest TCR signals during development are engendered with the highest expression of GITR, OX40, and TNFR2. Moreover, mature T<sub>reg</sub> cells express substantially more OX40 and GITR than T<sub>reg</sub> progenitors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1a</xref>) suggesting that T<sub>reg</sub> progenitors expressing relatively more of these TNFRSF members have a selective advantage in thymic T<sub>reg</sub> differentiation.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>TAK1 and CD28 govern GITR, OX40 and TNFR2 expression</title><p id="P10">To identify the pathways downstream of the TCR that entrain expression of specific TNFRSF members we used mice that lack the MAPK kinase kinase TAK1 (also known as MAP3K7) specifically in T cells (<italic><sc>c</sc>d4<sup>Cre</sup> &#x000d7; Tak1<sup><sc>fl</sc>/<sc>fl</sc></sup></italic> mice; Tak1 KO). TAK1 links TCR signaling to NF-&#x003ba;B activation<sup><xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup> and thus is a key signaling intermediate downstream of the TCR. Previous studies have documented that TAK1-deficiency profoundly blocks thymic T<sub>reg</sub> differentiation but did not examine effects on T<sub>reg</sub> progenitors as these studies preceded the identification of this cell population<sup><xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, <xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup>.

These T<sub>reg</sub> progenitors fail to express GITR, OX40, and TNFR2 on their surface and do not convert into mature Foxp3<sup>+</sup> T<sub>reg</sub> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2c,d</xref> and data not shown). In contrast, CD27 expression was not affected by TAK1-deficiency. Thus, TAK1 is required for TCR-induced expression of GITR, OX40, and TNFR2 on T<sub>reg</sub> progenitors.</p><p id="P11">We also examined the surface expression of TNFRSF in T<sub>reg</sub> progenitors from CD28-deficient mice, as CD28 plays an important role in T<sub>reg</sub> development<sup><xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>-<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup>. <italic>Cd28</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice showed a significant reduction in GITR and OX40 expression on T<sub>reg</sub> progenitors relative to BALB/c controls; a more modest trend toward reduced TNFR2 expression was also observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2c,d</xref>, bottom panels). In contrast, CD27 surface expression on T<sub>reg</sub> progenitors was unaffected by the absence of CD28. Similar results were obtained with <italic>Cd28</italic><sup>AYAA</sup> knockin mice (data not shown), which lack the distal proline-rich motif that was previously shown to be required for T<sub>reg</sub> development<sup><xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup>.

Thus, CD28 signals are also required for upregulation of GITR and OX40 expression (and likely TNFR2) on T<sub>reg</sub> progenitors.</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>GITR, OX40 or TNFR2 costimulation drives T<sub>reg</sub> maturation</title><p id="P12">To determine if signaling through GITR, OX40 or TNFR2 directly augments T<sub>reg</sub> development by promoting maturation of T<sub>reg</sub> progenitors, we utilized an assay that models step 2 of T<sub>reg</sub> development <italic>in vitro</italic> (i.e., the IL-2-dependent conversion of T<sub>reg</sub> progenitors into mature Foxp3+ T<sub>reg</sub> cells). Purified T<sub>reg</sub> progenitors sorted from Foxp3-GFP reporter mice were incubated in culture with low dose IL-2 with or without agonist TNFSF ligands. Conversion was assessed as the frequency of cells that acquired Foxp3-GFP expression during the course of the incubation. The addition of GITR-L&#x02013;Fc, OX40-L&#x02013;Fc, or TNF plus IL-2 enhanced conversion to Foxp3<sup>+</sup> T<sub>reg</sub> cells by ~2-3 fold when compared to treatment with IL-2 alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3a,b</xref>). In contrast, three independent CD27 agonists (CD70&#x02013;Fc, soluble CD70, and an agonist monoclonal antibody to CD27) did not enhance T<sub>reg</sub> development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3a,b</xref> and data not shown). T<sub>reg</sub> progenitors do not express 41BB or CD30, and as expected, stimulation with 41BB-L or CD30-L did not affect T<sub>reg</sub> development (data not shown).</p><p id="P13">One potential mechanism by which TNFRSF agonists promote T<sub>reg</sub> development is to enhance sensitivity to IL-2. To directly test this, we examined CD25 expression on both Foxp3-GFP<sup>&#x02212;</sup> T<sub>reg</sub> progenitors and Foxp3-GFP<sup>+</sup> mature T<sub>reg</sub> cells that had been stimulated with IL-2 &#x000b1; GITR-L&#x02013;Fc. CD25 expression was significantly enhanced on both T<sub>reg</sub> progenitors and mature T<sub>reg</sub> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3c,d</xref>). To examine the relative effect of TNFRSF co-stimulation on IL-2-dependent T<sub>reg</sub> differentiation we carried out a dose-response experiment. Stimulation of T<sub>reg</sub> progenitors with 1 U/mL IL-2 plus GITR-L or OX40-L resulted in 50% maximal conversion to mature T<sub>reg</sub> cells; in the absence of GITR-L or OX40-L co-stimulation, almost 10-fold more IL-2 was required to achieve the same effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3e</xref>). Agonist GITR-L&#x02013;Fc, OX40-L&#x02013;Fc, or TNF did not promote T<sub>reg</sub> maturation in the absence of IL-2 (data not shown). Finally, we observed that GITR-L&#x02013;Fc costimulation enhanced IL-2-dependent STAT5 phosphorylation in T<sub>reg</sub> progenitors, suggesting that GITR-L acts directly on the IL-2R signaling pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3f</xref>). These data demonstrate that GITR, OX40, or TNFR2 costimulation augments IL-2 responsiveness in T<sub>reg</sub> progenitors and allows them to effectively respond to low and likely physiologically relevant levels of IL-2.</p><p id="P14">An alternative mechanism by which TNFRSF costimulation enhances T<sub>reg</sub> development is through the induction of anti-apoptotic proteins. To address this, we determined whether blocking apoptosis via the addition of the pan-caspase inhibitor, z-VAD-fmk, had a similar effect in promoting T<sub>reg</sub> development to GITR-L&#x02013;Fc. The addition of z-VAD-fmk significantly increased total cell recovery (p&#x0003c;0.02, data not shown); however, z-VAD-fmk did not enhance IL-2-dependent conversion of T<sub>reg</sub> progenitors into mature T<sub>reg</sub> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3g</xref>). Thus, costimulation via GITR, OX40, and TNFR2 provide more than just pro-survival signals to developing T<sub>reg</sub> cells.</p></sec><sec id="S8"><title>GITR- or OX40-deficiency modestly blocks T<sub>reg</sub> development</title><p id="P15">We next sought to determine if TNFRSF members drive T<sub>reg</sub> differentiation <italic>in vivo</italic> in a cell-intrinsic manner.

T<sub>reg</sub> progenitor populations were also slightly reduced in GITR-deficient cells, although the reduction was significantly less than observed in mature Foxp3+ T<sub>reg</sub> cells.

To test this hypothesis, we generated Foxp3-RFP &#x000d7; Nur77-GFP reporter mice. We then sorted T<sub>reg</sub> progenitors and stimulated them with IL-2 and increasing doses of agonist GITR-L&#x02013;Fc. Increasing GITR-L concentration led to the development of a T<sub>reg</sub> population with reduced expression of Nur77-GFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7a</xref>). This was not due to a loss of T<sub>reg</sub> cells with high TCR signal strength, but rather inclusion of cells with lower Nur77-GFP expression.

Thus, TNFRSF costimulation plays a critical role in the differentiation of all potential T<sub>reg</sub> progenitors into mature T<sub>reg</sub> cells, and competition for TNFSF ligands regulates TCR repertoire selection during T<sub>reg</sub> development.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="S12"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P22">T<sub>reg</sub> development is a finely tuned process that is critical for preventing autoimmune disease. An intriguing feature of T<sub>reg</sub> development is that this process discriminates between relative differences in TCR signal strength. T<sub>reg</sub> cells with TCRs that recognize self-ligands with high-affinity predominate, although T<sub>reg</sub> cells with lower-affinity TCRs can be found<sup><xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>, <xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref></sup>. The molecular program that accounts for this skewing process remains to be fully elucidated. One recent mechanism that has been proposed is TCR-induced expression of the NR4A family of transcription factors including NUR77, NOR1, and NURR1<sup><xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref></sup>. Expression of these transcription factors correlates with TCR signal strength<sup><xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup> and these three transcription factors bind the <italic>Foxp3</italic> gene and are redundantly required for T<sub>reg</sub> development<sup><xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref></sup>. This suggests that one potential mechanism to link TCR signal strength to T<sub>reg</sub> development involves this transcription factor family. However, it is unlikely that this is the only mechanism that links TCR signal strength to T<sub>reg</sub> development. For example, T<sub>reg</sub> progenitors have clearly induced expression of NUR77 as documented by Nur77-GFP reporter mice yet they do not express Foxp3. In addition, in <italic>Bim</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice, many CD4SP thymocytes that have escaped deletion have high expression of NUR77 yet they do not differentiate into Foxp3<sup>+</sup> T<sub>reg</sub> cells<sup><xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref></sup>. TCR signals give rise to graded levels of NUR77 expression in thymocytes, yet Foxp3 is expressed in relative quantum increments with essentially no expression in T<sub>reg</sub> progenitors and high levels in mature T<sub>reg</sub> cells. If the effect of NUR77 family members on <italic>Foxp3</italic> transcription was truly linear then one might expect a continuum of Foxp3 expression in T<sub>reg</sub> progenitors culminating in that seen in mature T<sub>reg</sub> cells; that is not observed experimentally suggesting that other mechanisms must also contribute to the process of linking TCR signal strength to T<sub>reg</sub> differentiation.</p><p id="P23">We propose that the TNFRSF members GITR, OX40 and TNFR2 also play a critical role in converting strong TCR signals into molecular pathways that drive T<sub>reg</sub> differentiation. In support of this hypothesis we observed that T<sub>reg</sub> progenitors express much greater amounts of GITR, OX40, and TNFR2 relative to conventional CD4<sup>+</sup>CD25<sup>&#x02212;</sup>Foxp3<sup>&#x02212;</sup> thymocytes and that the level of expression of these receptors correlates directly with TCR signal strength as read out using Nur77-GFP reporter mice. This results in a competitive advantage as mature Foxp3<sup>+</sup> T<sub>reg</sub> cells express even greater amounts of GITR and OX40. Blocking signaling via these receptors either by neutralizing antibodies or through combinations of gene knockouts and dominant negative receptors completely abrogates T<sub>reg</sub> development. Thus, signaling through these receptors is collectively required for thymic T<sub>reg</sub> development <italic>in vivo</italic>. Finally, the relative abundance of TNFSF ligands directly affects the TCR repertoire in developing T<sub>reg</sub> cells. T<sub>reg</sub> progenitors expressing the highest affinity TCRs, and hence the highest amounts of GITR, OX40, and TNFR2 can more effectively compete for their respective TNFSF ligands, and are thereby more likely to differentiate into mature T<sub>reg</sub> cells.</p><p id="P24">The mechanism by which GITR, OX40 and TNFR2 promote T<sub>reg</sub> development appears to primarily have effects on cell differentiation and not survival. GITR-L and OX40-L costimulation resulted in an ~10-fold increase in sensitivity to low doses of IL-2 that likely mimic what is available <italic>in vivo</italic>. This most likely reflects a direct effect on IL-2R signaling, as downstream STAT5 phosphorylation was also enhanced by costimulation with TNFSF agonists. Since GITR, OX40, and TNFR2 are known to signal via the NF&#x003ba;B pathway, we examined the expression of two NF&#x003ba;B-regulated genes that affect IL-2R signaling. We observed increased expression of CD25 on both T<sub>reg</sub> progenitors and mature T<sub>reg</sub> cells following costimulation with GITR-L, OX40-L, or TNF. In contrast, <italic>Socs1</italic> expression (which is induced by IL-2 signaling, and negatively regulated by NF&#x003ba;B via mIR-155<sup><xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref></sup>) was unaffected by GITR-L costimulation of T<sub>reg</sub> progenitors (data not shown). When evaluating the effects of costimulation on mature T<sub>reg</sub> cells, however, we observed that GITR-L reduced the <italic>Socs1</italic> expression induced by IL-2 stimulation by approximately 50% (data not shown). Thus, the predominant effect of GITR-L costimulation on enhancing T<sub>reg</sub> progenitor sensitivity to IL-2 appears to be via CD25 induction.</p><p id="P25">An additional mechanism by which GITR, OX40, and TNFR2 could influence T<sub>reg</sub> development is through the induction of anti-apoptotic genes<sup><xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>, <xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref></sup>. Such a mechanism has been proposed to account for the modest effect of CD27-CD70 on T<sub>reg</sub> development<sup><xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup>. We did observe that GITR, OX40, and TNFR2 costimulation weakly induced Bcl2 protein in T<sub>reg</sub> progenitors (data not shown). However, blocking apoptosis with caspase inhibitors did not mimic the effect of GITR-L costimulation. Preliminary results with mice overexpressing Bcl2 indicate that ectopic anti-apoptotic gene expression does not prevent the defect in T<sub>reg</sub> development imposed by TNFRSF blockade (data not shown). Thus, unlike CD27, which promotes cell survival, the induction of anti-apoptotic gene expression by GITR, OX40, or TNFR2 costimulation is not the dominant mechanism by which these TNFRSF drive T<sub>reg</sub> differentiation.</p><p id="P26">It is unclear why three distinct TNFRSF members are required for T<sub>reg</sub> differentiation. One possible explanation is that partial redundancy limits the chances of defects in T<sub>reg</sub> development. A similar biological redundancy is observed for the NR4A transcription factor family in which neither NUR77, NOR1, or NURR1 is individually critical, but loss of all three stringently prevents T<sub>reg</sub> development<sup><xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref></sup>. Alternatively, it is possible that selection for multiple TNFRSF members on mature T<sub>reg</sub> cells is important for their later function. For example, ligation of OX40 or GITR on mature T<sub>reg</sub> cells has been shown to limit their suppressor function<sup><xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup>. In this regard, enhanced selection of T<sub>reg</sub> progenitors that express GITR and OX40 in the thymus could function as a possible safeguard to shut down their suppressive function during inflammatory responses to pathogens. Other reports have suggested that expression of TNFRSF members is required to maintain survival of mature T<sub>reg</sub> cells during inflammatory conditions<sup><xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>, <xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref></sup>. Finally, it is possible that higher expression of GITR and OX40 allows T<sub>reg</sub> cells that most avidly recognize self-ligand to preferentially compete for IL-2 needed to sustain these cells in peripheral lymphoid organs.</p><p id="P27">In conclusion, our data support a model of T<sub>reg</sub> differentiation in which developing thymocytes that bind MHC-II:self-peptide ligands with higher-affinity express greater amounts of GITR, OX40 and TNFR2. This elevated expression of select TNFRSF members on highly self-reactive T<sub>reg</sub> progenitors results in a selective advantage that allows those cells to preferentially undergo maturation. Thus, upregulation of GITR, OX40, and TNFR2 by T<sub>reg</sub> progenitors is a mechanism by which high-affinity TCR signals are translated into physical parameters that allow for more effective competition for IL-2 in a tightly regulated developmental niche. In agreement with previous reports<sup><xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref></sup>, our model still allows for cells bearing TCRs with lower affinity for MHC-II:self-peptide complexes to emerge in the thymic T<sub>reg</sub> population, but strongly favors T<sub>reg</sub> differentiation in thymocytes receiving strong TCR signals since these cells most strongly upregulate TNFRSF receptors. This precisely matches the observed TCR affinity distribution in mature T<sub>reg</sub> cells<sup><xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup>. Thus, TNFSF ligand availability is an additional level of control by which thymic APCs define the T<sub>reg</sub> developmental niche and couple TCR affinity to T<sub>reg</sub> development.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="S13"><title>Online Methods</title><sec id="S14"><title>Mice</title><p id="P28">All mice were housed in specific-pathogen free facilities at the University of Minnesota and experiments were performed in accordance with protocols approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. <italic>Gitr </italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice were previously described<sup><xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> and provided by Drs.

After 16 hours, sodium butyrate was added to the culture medium to a final concentration of 10 mM to enhance viral production. Eight hours later, medium was replaced to begin collecting retroviral particles. Supernatants were collected and medium replaced at 24 and 48 hours. After filtration through 0.45 &#x003bc;m filters, viral particles were centrifuged onto Retronectin-coated 6 well plates (Clontech Laboratories, Mountain View, CA) prior to overlaying <italic>Ox40</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> bone marrow cells at a density of 3 million cells per well. Bone marrows used for transduction had been isolated the previous day, depleted of T and B cells, and stimulated with 10 ng/mL IL-3 and IL-6, and 50 ng/ml SCF (Peprotech) to induce cell division. Medium and cytokines were replenished at the first and second retroviral transductions. Twenty-four hours after the second transduction, bone marrow was collected and <italic>Ox40</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> cells were mixed 80%/20% with congenically marked wild type bone marrow that had been stimulated identically in culture with cytokines.
