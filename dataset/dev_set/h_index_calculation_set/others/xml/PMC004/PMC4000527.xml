Despite its prevalence, the physiological function and regulation of microtubule acetylation remains poorly understood. Here we report that macrophages challenged by bacterial lipopolysaccharides (LPS) undergo extensive microtubule acetylation. Suppression of LPS-induced microtubule acetylation by inactivating the tubulin acetyltransferase, MEC17, profoundly inhibits the induction of anti-inflammatory interlukin-10 (IL-10), a phenotype effectively reversed by an acetylation-mimicking &#x003b1;-tubulin mutant. Conversely, elevating microtubule acetylation by inhibiting the tubulin deacetylase, HDAC6, or stabilizing microtubules via Taxol, stimulates IL-10 hyper-induction. Supporting the anti-inflammatory function of microtubule acetylation, HDAC6 inhibition significantly protects mice from LPS toxicity. In HDAC6-deficient macrophages challenged by LPS, p38 kinase signaling becomes selectively amplified, leading to SP1-dependent IL-10 transcription. Remarkably, the augmented p38 signaling is suppressed by MEC17 inactivation. Our findings identify reversible microtubule acetylation as a kinase signaling modulator and a key component in the inflammatory response.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="S1"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Acetylation on lysine (K) 40 of &#x003b1;-tubulin is an evolutionarily conserved modification controlled by the acetyltransferase MEC17 (also termed &#x003b1;TAT1)<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> and the deacetylase HDAC6<sup><xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup>.

Thus under laboratory conditions, microtubule acetylation is neither essential for development nor survival. These unexpected findings raise the possibility that microtubule acetylation might be associated with stress or adaptive response that promotes post-embryonic fitness.</p><p id="P3">The tubulin deacetylase, HDAC6, has emerged as a promising therapeutic target. Genetic and pharmacological inhibition of HDAC6 has been shown to suppress neurodegenerative disorders, enhance immune-modulatory activity, and alleviate depressive behaviors in animal models<sup><xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup>. Although enhanced tubulin acetylation is often cited as the basis for the observed beneficial effects, the evidence is largely indirect. The critical question of how microtubule acetylation might intersect with various disorders is also not understood. The growing list of HDAC6 substrates further suggests that additional mechanism independent of tubulin acetylation might be involved<sup><xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup>. Identifying the relevant substrate and underlying mechanism in this context would be critical for devising HDAC6-targeted therapies.</p><p id="P4">In this report, we present evidence that microtubule acetylation is a critical component of innate immunity. Microtubule acetylation is induced by bacterial lipopolysaccharides (LPS) treatment and selectively required for the production of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10. Modulation of tubulin acetylation by targeting MEC17 and HDAC6 profoundly affects IL-10 production and anti-inflammatory activity in macrophages and in mice. We further show that microtubule acetylation selectively enhances p38 signaling, leading to SP-1 dependent IL-10 transcription. Our study identifies acetylated microtubules as a signal amplifier and a key target in HDAC6-targeted therapies.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="S2"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>HDAC6 deficiency leads to hyper-induction of IL-10</title><p id="P5">Innate immunity is critical for host defense against infectious agents but dispensable in a controlled laboratory environment. We therefore considered a potential role for microtubule acetylation in innate immune response. Macrophages are the key components in innate immunity by producing inflammatory cytokines and presenting foreign antigens. To investigate whether microtubule acetylation regulates macrophage function, we constructed macrophage lines (Raw264.7) with stable knockdown of HDAC6 by shRNAs (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1a</xref>) and assessed their ability to produce inflammatory cytokines upon bacterial LPS challenge. We found that HDAC6 knockdown (KD) modestly reduced the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, TNF-alpha and IL&#x02013;1beta (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1b</xref>) as well as IL-6 (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 1a</xref>). In stark contrast, the production of anti-inflammatory IL-10 was dramatically elevated in HDAC6 KD macrophages, more than five fold higher than control macrophages (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1c</xref>). To confirm this finding, we examined bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDM) isolated from HDAC6 knockout (KO) mice. A similar hyper-induction of IL-10 (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1d</xref>), but minor changes in pro-inflammatory cytokines (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 1b</xref>), was observed in HDAC6 KO primary macrophages treated with LPS. Importantly, LPS treatment also induced higher levels of serum IL-10 in HDAC6 KO mice than wild type mice <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1e</xref>). These results show that HDAC6 regulates IL-10 production induced by LPS.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>LPS-induced IL-10 requires MEC17 and &#x003b1;&#x02013;tubulin acetylation</title><p id="P6">We found that the hyper-induction of IL-10 in HDAC6 KD macrophages can be effectively suppressed by the re-introduction of a wild type, but not <underline>c</underline>atalytic <underline>i</underline>nactive (Ci) mutant, HDAC6 indicating that the deacetylase activity of HDAC6 is required for regulating IL-10 production (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 1c&#x02013;d</xref>). Supporting this notion, treatment with an HDAC6-selective inhibitor, Tubastatin A (TBSA<sup><xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup>), strongly elevated IL-10 production in Raw264.7 induced by LPS (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2a</xref>). We next investigated whether microtubule acetylation is involved in IL-10 production. We assessed microtubule acetylation by staining LPS-activated macrophages with an acetylated &#x003b1;-tubulin-specific antibody<sup><xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup>. This staining revealed a time-dependent increase in acetylated microtubules following LPS treatment (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2b</xref>). Immuno-blotting confirmed that microtubule acetylation was indeed induced by LPS treatment (Ac-tubulin, <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2c</xref>). Interestingly, LPS also caused a parallel increase in the tubulin acetyltransferase MEC17, whereas the deacetylase HDAC6 was largely unaffected (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2c</xref>). Thus, LPS induces MEC17 and microtubule acetylation in activated macrophages.</p><p id="P7">To investigate whether MEC17 plays a role in IL-10 production, we knocked down MEC17 by two different shRNAs. Both MEC17 shRNAs led to a reduction in &#x003b1;-tubulin acetylation as expected (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 2a</xref>). Importantly, this was accompanied by a strong decrease in IL-10 production in TBSA-treated (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2d</xref>) or HDAC6 KD macrophages challenged by LPS (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 2c</xref>). Similar to HDAC6 inactivation, MEC17 KD had only a modest effect on pro-inflammatory cytokine production (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 2d&#x02013;f</xref>). Interestingly, MEC17 KD also inhibited IL-10 production in control macrophages, indicating that MEC17 is a normal regulatory component in IL-10 production induced by LPS (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2d</xref>, first two columns, <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 2b</xref>). Collectively, these results demonstrate an opposing activity of MEC17 and HDAC6 in IL-10 induction by LPS, thereby implicating microtubule acetylation in the regulation of anti-inflammatory IL-10 production.</p><p id="P8">In addition to &#x003b1;-tubulin, HDAC6 has other substrates<sup><xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup>. To substantiate that HDAC6 and MEC17 regulate IL-10 production via microtubule acetylation, we took two additional approaches. First, if MEC17 controls IL-10 production by catalyzing &#x003b1;-tubulin acetylation, over-expression of an acetylation-mimicking &#x003b1;-tubulin should complement MEC17 knockdown and restore IL-10 production. Molecular modeling indicates that K40&#x02192;Q (glutamine) mutation could mimic acetylation by promoting the formation of microtubule interprotofilament salt bridges<sup><xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup>. We electroporated expression plasmids encoding for wild type, acetylation-mimicking K40&#x02192;Q, or acetylation-deficient K40&#x02192;R &#x003b1;-tubulin into MEC17 KD cells followed by LPS treatment. Both K40&#x02192;Q and K40&#x02192;R &#x003b1;-tubulin mutants can be effectively incorporated into the microtubule network<sup><xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup>. As shown in Figure (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2e</xref>), over-expression of the acetylation-mimicking K40&#x02192;Q, but not acetylation-deficient K40&#x02192;R, &#x003b1;-tubulin mutant significantly restored IL-10 production in MEC17 KD cells. These results indicate that MEC17 regulates IL-10 production by increasing microtubule acetylation. Second, we took advantage of the observation that stable microtubules are more heavily acetylated<sup><xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup>. Accordingly, we treated macrophages with a microtubule destabilizing agent, nocodazole, and a stabilizing drug, Taxol, to decrease and increase microtubule acetylation, respectively. We found that nocodazole treatment reduced &#x003b1;-tubulin acetylation (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2f</xref>) and significantly blunted LPS-induced IL-10 production in both wild type and HDAC6 KD macrophages (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2f</xref>). In contrast, Taxol treatment led to a dose-dependent increase in &#x003b1;-tubulin acetylation, which was accompanied by a higher induction of IL-10 (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2g</xref>). Importantly, the effect of Taxol on IL-10 production can be significantly reversed by MEC17 knockdown (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2h</xref>). Neither nocodazole nor Taxol treatment markedly affected the production of pro-inflammatory TNF-alpha, IL-6 or IL-1beta (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 3</xref>). These results show that LPS-induced IL-10 production is positively regulated by the buildup of acetylated microtubules.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>&#x003b1;-tubulin acetylation amplifies LPS-induced p38 MAPK signal</title><p id="P9">IL-10 production is regulated by the MAP kinases p38 and ERK, which activate IL-10 gene transcription (reviewed in<sup><xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup>). We next sought to determine if microtubule acetylation affects MAPK signaling linked to IL-10 production. LPS treatment induced transient phosphorylation and activation of p38, ERK and JNK (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3a&#x02013;b</xref>, Lanes 1&#x02013;6), as was previously reported<sup><xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup>. Remarkably, we found that inhibition of HDAC6 by TBSA markedly increased the intensity and duration of LPS-induced p38 phosphorylation (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3a</xref>, compare Lanes 1&#x02013;6 and 7&#x02013;12). In contrast, TBSA only modestly affected phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and JNK (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3b</xref>). Robust and prolonged p38 phosphorylation was also observed in HDAC6 KO primary macrophages challenged by LPS (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 4a</xref>). Most importantly, the augmented p38 phosphorylation caused by TBSA was abrogated by MEC17 knockdown (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3a</xref>, Lanes 19&#x02013;24). MEC17 knockdown, in fact, also reduced phosphorylated p38, but not ERK or JNK, in control macrophages challenged by LPS (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3a</xref>, Lanes 13&#x02013;18), further supporting a specific regulatory role of microtubule acetylation in LPS-induced p38 signaling. Consistent with these findings, production of IL-10 in HDAC6 KD macrophages was strongly suppressed by a p38 inhibitor (SB202190) but not a JNK inhibitor (SP600125, <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3c, d</xref>). These results indicate that microtubule acetylation positively and specifically amplifies p38 kinase signaling and stimulates IL-10 production.</p><p id="P10">Real time PCR analysis showed that hyper-induction of IL-10 in HDAC6 deficient cells at the mRNA level (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3e</xref>). p38 promotes IL-10 production, at least in part, via the transcription factor Sp1<sup><xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup>. We found that an Sp1 inhibitor, mithramycin, strongly suppressed IL-10 production in both control and HDAC6 deficient macrophages (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3f</xref>). Mithramycin only modestly affected TNF-alpha, IL-1beta and IL-6 production (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 4b&#x02013;d</xref>), providing further evidence that the acetylated microtubule-p38-Sp1 signaling axis selectively regulates IL-10 production. In contrast to Sp1, inactivation of the AP1 transcription factor had a much weaker effect on IL-10 production (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 5</xref>), consistent with a previous report<sup><xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup>. These results provide evidence that MEC17/HDAC6-dependent microtubule acetylation modulates the strength of p38 signaling, which in turn, determines SP1 dependent transcriptional induction of IL-10.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>HDAC6 inhibition protects mice from acute toxicity of LPS</title><p id="P11">The induction of IL-10 is critical for down-modulating pro-inflammatory response and preventing tissue injury caused by excessive inflammation (reviewed in<sup><xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup>). Accordingly, an enhancement of IL-10 production by HDAC6 inactivation should dampen LPS-induced inflammation and toxicity in mice. To test this possibility, we injected C57BL6 mice with a dose of LPS that would typically cause cytokine storm and lethality alone or in conjunction with TBSA. As shown in <xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4a</xref>, mice that received TBSA showed much higher serum IL-10 levels after LPS treatment. Interestingly, TNF-alpha, IL6 and IL1-beta levels were all reduced (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4b&#x02013;d</xref>), supporting the anti-inflammatory activity of TBSA in <italic>vivo</italic>. Importantly, mice that received TBSA had a significantly higher survival rate compared to WT mice at all time points examined (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4e</xref>). Similar cytokine profile and survival advantage were also observed in HDAC6 KO mice treated with LPS (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 6</xref>).

Our study has provided evidence that microtubule acetylation is a critical regulatory component for p38 kinase signaling in macrophages. The buildup of acetylated microtubules in response to LPS augments and sustains p38 signaling that stimulates anti-inflammatory IL-10 production. Since microtubule acetylation does not directly affect the production of key pro-inflammatory cytokines (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1b</xref>, <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 2</xref> and <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3</xref>), these findings suggest that HDAC6 inhibitors would promote natural resolution of pathological inflammation by stimulating IL-10 production while permitting the initiation of pro-inflammatory response. Indeed, we found that TBSA treatment significantly protects mice from inflammatory shock induced by LPS (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4</xref>). The increase in IL-10 production could potentially contribute to the reported neuro-protective and anti-depressive effects of HDAC6 inhibition where inflammation is known to be a pathogenic factor<sup><xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>, <xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup>. Of interest, HDAC6 deficient T regulatory cells are more active than their wild type counterparts in suppressing T effector cell proliferation<sup><xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup>. Whether microtubule acetylation also plays a similar regulatory role in adaptive immunityis a critical issue to be determined.</p><p id="P13">Our study identifies p38 signaling as a key downstream effector of microtubule acetylation in macrophages (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3a</xref>) whereas JNK signaling is largely independent of microtubule acetylation (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3b</xref>). In macrophages, acetylated microtubules might be considered a unique &#x0201c;signal amplifier&#x0201d; where selective signaling events can be maintained and propagated. This proposition raises a possibility that axons and primary cilia, which are highly enriched for acetylated microtubules<sup><xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>, <xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup>, might use a similar mechanism to propagate selective signaling events. How microtubule acetylation selectively affects p38 signaling remains to be determined. Intriguingly, lysine 40 of &#x003b1;-tubulin is located inside the microtubule lumen and its acetylation increases the size of the lumen<sup><xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>, <xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></sup>. The finding that K40 acetylation-mimicking &#x003b1;-tubulin mutant can restore IL-10 production in MEC17 deficient cells (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2e</xref>) suggests that luminal dimension of microtubules could potentially affect p38 signaling. Whether the p38-signaling complex can enter the lumen of acetylated microtubules and signal from within is of great interest in the future.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="S8"><title>Methods</title><sec id="S9"><title>Antibodies and Reagents</title><p id="P14">The following antibodies were used for western blot: p-ERK1/2 (#4370,1:2000), ERK1/2 (#9102,1:1000), p-JNK (#4668, 1:1000), JNK (#9258,1:1000), p-p38 (#4511,1;1000), and p38 (#9212,1:1000) antibodies (Cells Signaling Technology), acetylated &#x003b1;-tubulin (T7451, 1:4000) and &#x003b1;-tubulin antibodies (T6074,1:4000) (Sigma Co., USA) and MEC17 (ABCAM: ab58742, 1:1000).

TBSA treatment markedly increased LPS-induced IL-10 production in a dose-dependent manner.<bold>(b)</bold> Macrophages were stained with an acetylated &#x003b1;-tubulin-specific antibody after LPS treatment at the indicated time. Immuno-staining showed that LPS treatment increased acetylated microtubules (Green: Ac-tubulin; Blue: DAPI; Scale bar: 10 &#x003bc;M). <bold>(c)</bold> Macrophages were treated with LPS and analyzed for acetylated tubulin, MEC17 and HDAC6 protein levels at indicated time. <bold>(d)</bold> MEC17 KD and control macrophages were pretreated with or without TBSA (10 &#x003bc;M) for 4h and followed by LPS treatment for 18 hours. Medium was harvested for IL-10 assay. Note that MEC17 KD strongly inhibited IL-10 production. <bold>(e)</bold> MEC17 KD macrophages were electroporated with pcDNA -EGFP, -EGFP-&#x003b1;-tubulin WT, K40&#x02192;R and K40&#x02192;Q mutant plasmids. 24 hours after transfection, cells were treated with LPS (1&#x003bc;g/ml) for 18 hours and medium was subjected to IL-10 analysis.

NOC treatment reduced &#x003b1;-tubulin acetylation (bottom panel: immuno-blotting) and significantly blunted LPS-induced IL-10 levels in control and HDAC6 KD macrophages (upper panel: ELISA). <bold>(g)</bold> Macrophages were pretreated with microtubule stabilizing agent, Taxol, for 4 hours and then followed by another 18-hours LPS treatment. Taxol treatment led to a dose-dependent increase in &#x003b1;-tubulin acetylation (bottom panel: immuno-blotting) and a higher induction of IL-10 (upper panel: ELISA). <bold>(h)</bold> MEC17 KD macrophages were pretreated with Taxol for 4 hours and followed by 18-hours of LPS treatment.

Male C57BL/6 mice were injected with either TBSA (0.5 mg/kg) or vehicle DMSO by daily I.P. for 7 days, followed by I.P. injection of LPS (50 ug/per mouse) or vehicle PBS (5 mice/group). After 4 hours, serum samples were harvested and cytokine concentrations were measured by ELISA. LPS-induced IL-10 levels in serum were markedly increased in TBSA injected mice, compared to DMSO vehicle injection (a). LPS-triggered TNF-alpha (b), IL-6 (c) and IL-1beta (d) levels in serum were decreased in TBSA-injected mice, compared to DMSO injected mice. The graph shows the means with SEM (error bars).
