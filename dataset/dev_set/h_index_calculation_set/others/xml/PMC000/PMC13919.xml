				members, all of which are highly alternatively spliced and glycosylated. For
				FGFR2, alternative splicing of the second half of the third Ig-like domain,
				involving exons IIIb and IIIc, is a mutually exclusive choice that affects
				ligand binding specificity and affinity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. It appears that the second half of
				the third Ig-like domain can dictate high affinity for FGF-2 or keratinocyte
				growth factor (KGF), whereas affinity for FGF-1 appears to remain the same
				[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Alternative splicing of the carboxyl terminus has
				been shown to involve at least two different exons that can produce at least
				three different variants. The C1-type and C2-type carboxyl termini are encoded
				by the same exon, and have two different splice acceptor sites, whereas the
				C3-type carboxyl terminus is encoded by a separate exon [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. The biologic significance of the C1 carboxyl terminus, as
				compared with the shorter C3 variant found primarily in tumorigenic samples,
				has been studied in NIH3T3 transfection assays, in which C3 variants were able
				to produce three times more transformed foci in soft agar than C1 variants
				(both IIIb), whereas full length FGFR2 and FGFR1 (both IIIc variants) showed no
				transforming activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>].</p><p>Previous studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]
				have found amplification and overexpression of FGFR2 in 5-10% of primary breast
				cancer specimens. A recent study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>] done using a tissue
				array consisting of 372 primary breast cancer specimens found a 5% incidence of
				FGFR2 amplification. To our knowledge, none of the HBC cell lines studied thus
				far have an FGFR2 gene amplification, although overexpression of FGFR2 message
				and protein has been documented for some breast cancer cell lines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>].</p><p>SUM-52PE is a breast cancer cell line previously isolated in our
				laboratory that grows under serum-free and epidermal growth factor-free
				conditions, has high levels of tyrosine-phosphorylated membrane proteins, and
				has the capacity to invade and grow under anchorage-independent conditions
				[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. This cell line exhibits all of the important hallmarks of
				transformed, highly malignant cells. Therefore, SUM-52PE was used as a model to
				study the diversity of FGFR2 expression in a breast cancer cell line that has
				true amplification and overexpression of FGFR2.</p></sec><sec><title>Objectives:</title><p>This study was conducted to examine the degree of FGFR2
				amplification and overexpression in the breast cancer cell line SUM-52PE.
				Subsequent sequencing and characterization of individual FGFR2 variants cloned
				from the SUM-52PE cell line was completed to determine the complexity of FGFR2
				alternative splicing in the context of a highly metastatic breast cancer cell
				line.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Southern, Northern and Western blot analyses were done in order to
				determine the degree of FGFR2 amplification and overexpression in the breast
				cancer cell line SUM-52PE. Individual FGFR2 variants were cloned out of
				SUM-52PE using FGFR2-specific primers in a reverse transcription (RT)
				polymerase chain reaction (PCR). FGFR2 cDNAs were characterized by restriction
				fragment analysis, sequencing and transient transfection into 293 cells to
				examine the protein expression of each FGFR2 clone.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>The results of the Southern blot showed that there was a 12-fold
				amplification of FGFR2 in the SUM-52PE cell line. Northern blot analysis of
				SUM-52PE showed FGFR2 transcripts to be highly overexpressed compared with
				other breast cancer cell lines and normal HME cells. Several overexpressed
				bands of approximately 6.3, 5.0, 4.0, and 2.8kb were observed in SUM-52PE
				cells. The most prominent band, at 2.8kb, was so abundant that it was difficult
				to discern other individual bands clearly. Western blot analysis showed that
				both normal HME and HBC cells expressed two FGFR2 variants of 95 and 135kDa.
				The SUM-52PE cell line greatly overexpressed not only these two polypeptides,
				as compared with HME and HBC cells, but also overexpressed two unique variants
				of FGFR2 - 85 and 109kDa polypeptides - as well as several smaller polypeptides
				in the 46-53kDa range. The antibody used in Western blot analysis only
				recognizes FGFR2 isoforms that express the C1 carboxyl termini, therefore
				greatly underestimating the actual number of different FGFR2 variants that are
				overexpressed in this cell line.</p><p>PCR was performed to determine the proportion of C1/C2 variants as
				compared with C3 variants in the SUM-52PE cell line. Results of this analysis
				indicated the presence of all three types of variants in this cell line,
				although the C1/C2 variants were predominant as compared with the C3 variants
				in SUM-52PE.</p><p>Four different FGFR2-C1 clones were isolated and sequenced from
				SUM-52PE cells, which differed in their signal sequence, first Ig-like loop,
				and acid box. Two FGFR2-C2 clones were isolated from the SUM-52PE cell line,
				which were identical to each other except for the variable expression of the
				number of Ig-like domains (two or three). Three C3 clones were isolated and
				sequenced, two of which have not previously been described in the literature.
				Clone C3-#3 contained two Ig-like domains, but no acid box. C3-#5 was missing
				the first two Ig-like domains and the acid box, but did contain the third
				Ig-like domain.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion:</title><p>There is an extensive amount of evidence implicating
				<italic>erbB-2</italic>, a gene that is overexpressed in approximately 30% of breast
				cancer cases, as a breast cancer gene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. The
				identification of other breast oncogenes that function in the remaining 70% of
				cases is an ongoing challenge, as is establishing a causal role for such
				oncogenes in HME cell transformation.</p><p>FGFR1 and FGFR2, previously established oncogenes, were found to
				be amplified within large amplicons on 8p11 and 10q26, respectively, in the
				breast cancer cell line SUM-52PE [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Previous studies
				have shown that the FGFR2 gene is amplified in about 5-10% of breast cancer
				cases.</p><p>Our results showed that SUM-52PE cells overexpressed many
				alternatively spliced isoforms of FGFR2 at both the transcript and protein
				level as compared with normal HME cells. The variability in FGFR2 isoform
				expression is complex and involves exon IIIb/c, which encodes the second half
				of the third Ig-like loop; variations in the carboxyl terminal end of the
				receptor, involving the C1/C2 or C3 domains; and variable expression of the
				Ig-like loops and acid box in the extracellular portion of the receptor. The
				characterization of three unique FGFR2 isoforms that were cloned from SUM-52PE
				may build on the findings of others concerning the transforming potential of
				FGFR2 variants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. In particular, because it has been
				demonstrated that expression of C3-IIIb variants may have more transforming
				activity than C1-IIIb variants, differences between the three C3 clones we have
				isolated may provide information regarding the influence of particular
				structural domains on transforming potential.</p><p>Ongoing studies are aimed at characterizing the transforming
				ability of FGFR2 isoforms obtained from SUM-52PE cells by transducing these
				genes into normal HME cells. By overexpressing FGFR2 isoforms in a
				physiologically relevant system, we hope to determine the isoform(s) that acts
				in a dominant way in the process of cell transformation, and to determine
				whether different regions present in individual clones drive specific
				phenotypes associated with transformation.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>alternative splicing</kwd><kwd>breast cancer</kwd><kwd>fibroblast growth factor receptor</kwd><kwd>receptor tyrosine kinase</kwd><kwd>SUM-52PE</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>The FGFs are a family of polypeptides consisting of 18 different
		  growth factors that bind with varying specificity and affinity to four
		  different FGFRs. FGFs stimulate proliferation of a wide variety of cells of
		  mesenchymal, neuronal, and epithelial origins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>], and have been found [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>] to
		  induce, inhibit, and maintain cell differentiation in different experimental
		  systems. In addition, FGFs have been shown to be involved in neuronal survival
		  [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>], and stimulation of angiogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>] and embryogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>].</p><p>The FGFRs are a family of receptors that are characterized by the
		  presence of two or three Ig-like domains and an acid box in the extracellular
		  domain, a transmembrane region, and a split kinase domain in the cytoplasmic
		  domain of the molecule [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Binding of FGF to heparin,
		  or cell-surface heparin sulfate proteoglycans, results in high-affinity binding
		  of this complex to FGFRs [219]. FGFRs subsequently undergo dimerization,
		  followed by transphosphorylation on cytoplasmic tyrosine residues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>].</p><p>FGFRs can be alternatively spliced into a variety of isoforms that may
		  have different functions. For example, at the amino terminus, which encodes the
		  ectodomain of the receptor, alternative splicing of exon III results in the
		  synthesis of either the IIIb or IIIc versions of FGFR2, which differ in their
		  ligand specificities. FGFR2-IIIb, also referred to as KGF receptor, has been
		  shown to be a high-affinity receptor for KGF, whereas FGFR2-IIIc receptors have
		  a high affinity for FGF-2. At the carboxyl terminus, FGFR2 can be alternatively
		  spliced to produce three different variants from two different exons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>].
		  C1/C2 variants are produced from the same exon with two different splice
		  acceptor sites. C3 variants are produced from a separate exon with a different
		  3' - noncoding region from that of C1/C2 variants, resulting in a shorter
		  form of FGFR2, which has been found [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>] to be the
		  predominant variant in stomach cancer cell lines as compared with normal
		  stomach tissue.</p><p>Overexpression and amplification of growth factor receptors are common
		  alterations observed in HBC cells. The FGFR1 and FGFR2 genes are expressed in
		  both normal and breast cancer tissues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>], and
		  alterations, including amplification and overexpression of FGFR1 and FGFR2,
		  have previously been reported in 5-10% of primary breast cancer specimens
		  [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. A recent study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>] that was done using a tissue array consisting of 372 primary
		  breast specimens found a 5% incidence of FGFR2 amplification.</p><p>There are at least four studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>] that have
		  analyzed the presence of FGFR2 message in breast cancer cell lines. These
		  studies show great discrepancy as to the presence or absence of FGFR2 message
		  and level of expression, possibly due to the method of detection (RT-PCR,
		  Northern blot, or ribonuclease protection assay). To our knowledge, none of the
		  HBC cell lines studied thus far have <italic>FGFR2</italic> gene amplification,
		  although overexpression of FGFR2 message and protein has been documented for
		  some breast cancer cell lines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>].</p><p>SUM-52PE is a breast cancer cell line previously isolated in this
		  laboratory that grows under serum-free and epidermal growth factor-free
		  conditions, has high levels of tyrosine phosphorylated membrane proteins, and
		  has the capacity to invade basement membranes and grow under

		  have amplifications of both FGFR1 and FGFR2 genes, exhibit all of the important
		  hallmarks of highly malignant cells. In order to understand better the
		  important molecular alterations that lead to this transformed phenotype, we
		  examined the contribution of FGFR2 overexpression to these characteristics.
		  Isolation and characterization of individual FGFR2 isoforms is an important
		  first step in identifying the contribution of this receptor to cell
		  transformation. Therefore, SUM-52PE was used as a model to study the diversity
		  of FGFR2 expression in a breast cancer cell line that has true amplification

				2 expression in SUM-52PE cells</title><p>To begin to characterize the FGFR2 transcripts that were present in

			 proportions of transcripts containing exon IIIb versus IIIc, and the proportion
			 of C1/C2 variants as compared with C3 variants.</p><p>RT-PCR analysis using exon III-specific primers was performed on
			 SUM-52PE mRNA, followed by restriction fragment analysis to determine the
			 presence of exon IIIb/c-expressing variants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. Exon
			 IIIb contains one unique Ava I site, whereas exon IIIc contains two Hinc III
			 sites. Therefore, the proportion of Ava I digest fragments to Hinc III digest
			 fragments allows for the determination of the proportion of IIIb to IIIc
			 variants present. Using this method, SUM-52PE cells were found to express only
			 IIIb isoforms, because the PCR product obtained was completely digested by Ava
			 I, whereas Hinc III failed to cut any of the amplified product (Fig.
			 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3a</xref>).</p><p>C1/C2 variants were amplified using a primer specific to the

			 specific for the C3 3' -noncoding region. Results of this analysis
			 indicated the presence of all three types of variants in this cell line,
			 although the C1/C2 variants (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3b</xref>; lanes 1 and 2)
			 appeared to be more abundant than the C3 variants in SUM-52PE (Fig.
			 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3b</xref>; lanes 3 and 4).</p></sec><sec><title>Isolation and analysis of alternatively spliced fibroblast growth
				factor receptor 2 variants</title><p>The PCR-based approach just described suggested that SUM-52PE cells
			 express exclusively IIIb type receptors, which can contain any of the three
			 carboxyl termini. The data also suggested that C1 and C2 variants are more
			 common than receptors with the C3 terminus. In order to characterize
			 definitively the range of FGFR2 variants expressed by SUM-52PE cells,
			 individual isoforms were cloned and sequenced from SUM-52PE RNA. To isolate
			 specific FGFR2 cDNAs, C1/C2- or C3-specific primers were used in combination
			 with a primer for the 5' end of the gene. RT-PCR amplified FGFR2 products
			 were purified and ligated into the bicistronic vector pZ. Individual clones
			 containing insert were characterized by restriction digest analysis,
			 sequencing, and transient transfection into 293 cells.</p><p>FGFR2 cDNA clones isolated from RNA derived from SUM-52PE cells were
			 highly variable and differed with respect to number of Ig-like loops expressed,
			 the presence or absence of the acid box, and the expression of C1, C2, or C3
			 carboxyl termini. As predicted from the PCR experiments, all FGFR2 variants
			 isolated from SUM-52PE expressed the IIIb exon.</p><p>Four different FGFR2-C1 clones were isolated and sequenced (Fig.
			 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). The largest clone, C1-#38, was a full-length
			 FGFR2-IIIb isoform, which was previously identified in the literature as KGF
			 receptor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. C1-#38 contained
			 three Ig-like domains, the characteristic acid box, and the C1 exon in the
			 carboxyl terminus. The other three C1 isoforms contained two Ig-like domains,
			 as well as exon IIIb, but differed with respect to the rest of their
			 extracellular domains. C1-#8 contained two Ig-like domains and the acid box in
			 the extracellular region. C1-#1 expressed two Ig-like domains, but was lacking
			 part of the extracellular region corresponding to the acid box. This type of
			 deletion has previously been identified as an FGFR2-IIIc variant, Bek103 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. C1-#10 was a unique variant that expressed two Ig-domains
			 and the acid box, but contained a unique deletion of the 5' region of the
			 receptor corresponding to the signal sequence. The functional significance of
			 this type of deletion has yet to be determined.</p><p>Two FGFR2-C2 clones were isolated from the SUM-52PE cell line (Fig.
			 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). Clone C2-#19 contained three Ig-like domains, the
			 acid box, and the C2 exon in the carboxyl termini. Clone C2-#5 contained two
			 Ig-like domains, but was missing part of the extracellular domain, which is
			 similar to, but smaller than the deletion characterized for clone C1-#1. A
			 clone identical to C2-#5 has previously been identified in the literature as
			 human K-sam C2, a variant isolated from the KATO-III human stomach
			 cancer-derived cell line [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Both K-sam and clone C2-#5
			 are missing the same 89 amino acid sequence in the 5' region of FGFR2
			 corresponding to the first Ig-like domain region.</p><p>Three C3 clones were isolated and sequenced, two of which have not
			 previously been described in the literature (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>).
			 C3-#4, a previously described FGFR2 variant, contained three Ig-like domains
			 and the acid box, and was considered a full-length C3 clone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Clone C3-#3 contained two Ig-like domains, but the lack of
			 the acid box makes this a unique C3 variant. C3-#5 was missing the first two
			 Ig-like domains and the acid box, but did contain the third Ig-like domain.
			 This FGFR2 isoform also has not previously been reported.</p><p>Because FGFR2 transcripts from HME cells were not detectable by
			 Northern blot, and because HME cells express FGFR2 protein that is detectable
			 by Western blot, experiments were performed to isolate FGFR2 clones from RNA
			 derived from normal HME cells. After two cycles of RT-PCR and subsequent
			 cloning into pZ, three different FGFR2 isoforms were obtained. As with the
			 SUM-52PE cells, all three isoforms cloned from HME cells contained exon IIIb.
			 Two clones with C1 carboxyl termini were isolated, one of which was full length
			 (the same as clone C1-#38 from SUM-52PE) and the second was missing the first
			 Ig loop (the same as clone C1-#8). One clone containing the C2 terminus was
			 isolated that was otherwise a full-length isoform (the same as clone
			 C2-#19).</p></sec><sec><title>Fibroblast growth factor receptor 2 protein expression in
				transfected 293 whole cell lysates</title><p>To assess the ability of the various FGFR2 isoforms isolated from
			 SUM-52PE cell RNA to synthesize protein, and to determine which FGFR2 clones
			 direct the synthesis of protein isoforms detected in Western blots, 293 cells
			 were transiently transfected with individual FGFR2 iso-forms using the
			 bicistronic pZ expression vector and analyzed by Western blot. As can be seen
			 in the left panel of Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5a</xref>, all four C1-containing
			 isoforms expressed protein in 293 cells and each clone gave rise to an FGFR2
			 isoform with distinct molecular size. Similarly, all three C3-containing clones
			 expressed protein in 293 cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5b</xref>). C3-containing
			 isoforms were visualized using a flag antibody that detects an epitope tag
			 incorporated into the design of the C3-specific primer. As can be seen from the
			 right panel of Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5b</xref>, the molecular sizes of the C3
			 variants correspond to what would be predicted on the basis of the size of the
			 individual clones. C3-#4 is full length at the amino terminus, C3-#3 is missing
			 the first Ig loop and the acid box, and C3-#5 is missing the first Ig loop, the
			 acid box and the second Ig loop.</p><p>Unfortunately, we cannot assess protein synthesis from any of the
			 C2-containing clones at this time. Because C1 and C2 are derived from the same
			 exon, and because we used a single primer to clone both C1- and C2-containing
			 variants, which did not contain an epitope tag, we are currently unable to
			 detect FGFR2-C2 proteins.</p><p>As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2b</xref>, two FGFR2-C1 proteins
			 (of 95 and 135kDa) are commonly detected in SUM-52PE cells, HME cells, and
			 other breast cancer cell lines. This is in accord with the observation that
			 both C1 variants cloned from HME cells were also cloned from SUM-52PE cells.
			 Thus, the data suggest that the common band that migrates at 135kDa represents
			 the glycosylated version of the full-length FGFR2-C1 (C1-#38: Fig.
			 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5a</xref>; lanes 1 and 4). Similarly, the second common band
			 that migrates at 95kDa is likely derived from clone C1-#8, which is missing the
			 first Ig loop (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5a</xref>; lanes 1 and 3). Clone C1-#1 was
			 highly expressed in 293 cells and resulted in the detection of multiple
			 immunoreactive proteins with a range of sizes (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5a</xref>;
			 lane 2). It is possible that this isoform, which is missing both the first Ig
			 loop and the acid box, is responsible for some of the high- and
			 low-molecular-weight bands detected in SUM-52PE Western blots, although more
			 work will be required to definitively demonstrate this. The contribution of
			 clone C1-#10, which was only weakly expressed in 293 cells, to FGFR2 protein
			 expression in SUM-52PE cells cannot be determined at this time (Fig.
			 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5a</xref>; lane 5).</p><p>As described above, clone C1-#38 encodes the full-length
			 FGFR2-IIIb/C1 form of the receptor and is expressed at the message level in
			 normal cells and all breast cancer cells examined, including SUM-52PE. However,
			 SUM-52PE cells also have an overexpressed band at 109kDa, which was also
			 detected in 293 cells transfected with clone C1-#38 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5a</xref>; lane 4) and in HME cells transduced with this clone (not
			 shown). This band was not detected in HME cells or any other breast cancer
			 cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2b</xref>; left panel). The molecular size of this
			 band corresponds to the size of the mature, non-processed, full-length protein,
			 suggesting that the 135kDa band corresponds to the fully glycosylated form of
			 the protein. The ability to detect this 109kDa non-processed form of
			 full-length FGFR2-IIIb/C1 only in SUM-52PE cells and cells transduced with
			 clone C1-#38 suggests that the protein is rapidly glycosylated in cells that
			 express physiologic levels of FGFR2. By contrast, in cells that overexpress
			 FGFR2, the 109-kDa nonglycosylated protein accumulates in the cell and is
			 detectable by Western blot as one of the unique bands shown in Figure
			 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2b</xref>. Thus, the detection of unique bands in Western blots
			 derived from SUM-52PE cells reflects not only differences in isoform synthesis
			 at the message level, but also differences in protein processing that occurs
			 when the protein is highly overexpressed. At present, the functional
			 consequences of the accumulation of nonglycosylated FGFR2 are not known.</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Amplification of FGFR1 and FGFR2 in SUM-52PE cells. <bold>(a)</bold> Genomic

		  multistep process that involves alterations in multiple signaling pathways.
		  Both epidermal growth factor receptor and erbB-2 have been identified as
		  signaling molecules that play a dominant role in breast cell transformation
		  [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. There is an extensive
		  amount of evidence for <italic>erbB-2</italic> as a breast cancer gene that is
		  overexpressed in approximately 30% of breast cancer cases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. The identification of other breast oncogenes that
		  function in the remaining 70% of cases is an ongoing challenge, as is
		  establishing a causal role for such oncogenes in HME cell transformation.</p><p>Large regions of gene amplification in cancer cells can be detected by
		  techniques such as comparative genomic hybridization and high-density arrays,
		  which helps to localize areas that may contain functional oncogenes. FGFR1 and
		  FGFR2, which were previously established as candidate breast cancer oncogenes,
		  were found to be amplified within large amplicons on 8p11 and 10q26,
		  respectively, in the breast cancer cell line SUM-52PE [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Previous studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>] have shown that the FGFR2 gene is
		  amplified in about 5-10% of cases. Because genes can be amplified without being
		  overexpressed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>], we chose to examine whether FGFR2
		  may be an important oncogene in this breast cancer cell line by examining its
		  expression at the mRNA and protein levels. Our results showed that SUM-52PE
		  cells overexpressed many alternatively spliced forms of FGFR2 at both the
		  transcript and protein level, as compared with normal mammary epithelial cells.
		  By contrast, FGFR1 is not expressed in SUM-52 cells.</p><p>In contrast to SUM-52PE cells, FGFR2 expression at the message level
		  is very low in HME cells. Indeed, even prolonged exposure of Northern blots to
		  film did not allow the visualization of FGFR2 message in normal cells. However,
		  Western blots did indicate the presence of FGFR2 protein in HME cells. To
		  resolve this apparent paradox, two rounds of RT-PCR were performed using HME
		  cell-derived RNA, which resulted in the isolation of three alternatively
		  spliced forms of FGFR2 message, each of which expressed the IIIb exon. The
		  predicted protein products of these clones correspond to that which was
		  observed in Western blots.</p><p>The variability in FGFR2 isoform expression is complex and involves
		  exon IIIb/c, which encodes the second half of the third Ig-like loop,
		  variations in the carboxyl terminal end of the receptor involving the C1/C2 or
		  C3 domains, and variable expression of the Ig-like loops and acid box in the
		  extracellular portion of the receptor.</p><p>Alternative splicing of the FGFR2 mRNA that encodes the carboxyl
		  terminus has been shown to involve at least two different exons, which can
		  produce at least three different variants. The C1- and C2-type carboxyl termini
		  are encoded by the same exon, having two different splice acceptor sites,
		  whereas the C3-type carboxyl terminus is encoded by a separate exon [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. The biologic significance of the full-length carboxyl
		  terminus (C1), as compared with the truncated variant found primarily in
		  tumorigenic samples (C3), has been studied in NIH3T3 transfection assays. The
		  IIIb variants KGF receptor (C1) and K-sam C3 were both able to produce
		  transformed foci, growth in soft agar and tumorigenicity in nude mice as
		  compared with full-length IIIc variants of FGFR2 and FGFR1, which were not
		  transforming [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. The question of whether C3 variants are
		  more transforming than C1 variants remains to be determined conclusively,
		  because the number of transformed foci obtained using K-sam C3 was only
		  threefold greater than that obtained using KGF receptor (C1) variants. A
		  significant difference between the C3 and C1 termini is that the former does
		  not contain the binding site for phospholipase C&#x003b3;. Thus, the ability of
		  the variants of FGFR2 containing the C3 terminus to transform 3T3 cells
		  suggests that signaling through this pathway is not necessary for FGFR2 IIIb to
		  act as an oncogene.</p><p>The panel of FGFR2 isoforms isolated from SUM-52PE includes several
		  unique and previously unreported isoforms. The first of these unique variants,
		  C1-#10, contains a large deletion of the 5' region that includes the
		  first Ig-like domain as well as the signal sequence, which could have
		  interesting cellular localization and cell signaling properties due to the
		  absence of part of the signal sequence. Clones C3-#3 and C3-#5 have not
		  previously been reported and are missing the first Ig-like domain and acid box.
		  C3-#5 is also missing the second Ig-like domain. The characterization of these
		  three unique isoforms may build upon the findings of others concerning the
		  transforming potential of FGFR2 variants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. In
		  particular, because it has been demonstrated that C3-IIIb variants may have
		  more transforming activity than C1-IIIb variants, differences between the three
		  C3 clones we have isolated may provide information on the influence of
		  particular structural domains on transforming potential.</p><p>Previous studies that examined FGFR2 expression in prostate cancer
		  have suggested that a change in the expression from the exon IIIb to IIIc
		  isoform correlates with a progression from an androgen-sensitive to an
		  androgen-insensitive state. RT-PCR analysis on the SUM-52PE breast cancer cell
		  line showed that this cell line exclusively expressed the IIIb FGFR2 isoform
		  (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). Exon IIIb expression was also exclusively found
		  in normal luminal HME cells (data not shown). This suggests that exon IIIb to
		  IIIc switching is not necessary for FGFR2 to act as an oncogene when the gene
		  is amplified. Rather, overexpression of one of the common IIIb isoforms or one
		  of the novel variants may be important in driving transformation of HME cells.
		  Ongoing studies are aimed at characterizing the transforming ability of
		  individual FGFR2 isoforms obtained from SUM-52PE cells. These studies will
		  directly test the hypothesis that specific FGFR2 isoforms have transforming
		  activity towards HME cells and will compare variants with the different
		  carboxyl termini. Overexpression of the C1-#38 and C3-#5 FGFR2 clones has been
		  successfully accomplished in both the MCF-10A and H16N2 HME cell lines, and
		  these cells have acquired phenotypes that distinguish them from parental cells
		  (to be described in detail in a separate paper that is in preparation). Thus,
		  by overexpressing FGFR2 isoforms in a physiologically relevant system, we hope
		  to determine the isoform(s) that acts in a dominant way in the process of cell
		  transformation, as well as to determine whether different regions present in
		  individual clones drive specific phenotypes associated with transformation.</p></sec></body><back><ack><sec><title>Acknowledgement</title><p>The pZ vector was kindly provided by Genetics Institute, Boston, MA,
