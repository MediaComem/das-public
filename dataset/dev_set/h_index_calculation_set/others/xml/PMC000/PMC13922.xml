This high frequency could not be ascribed to the expression of truncated mRNAs, or to the proteolysis of the native ER peptide at the time of homogenization or assay, suggesting an intracellular proteolysis. Free amino-terminal and ligand-binding domains maintained together within oligomeric structure(s); increase of ionic strength separated them. The amino-terminal region was consistently detected in the cell nucleus by specific immunohistochemistry leading to the concept of a potential intranuclear association between ER cleavage products and/or other regulatory proteins.</p></abstract><abstract><sec><title>Introduction:</title><p>We previously reported that about two-thirds of [<sup>125</sup>I]oestradiol-labelled cytosolic ERs from breast cancer samples eluted as low-molecular-weight isoforms (&#x02264; 37 kDa, size-exclusion fast pressure liquid chromatography [FPLC]). These isoforms failed to adsorb strongly to hydroxylapatite at high ionic strength, a property that was ascribed to receptors devoid of amino-terminal ABC domains. In view of recent data concerning intracellular proteolysis of several transcriptional regulators, the possibility of such behaviour for ER was assessed.</p><p>The clinical significance of ER measurement in breast cancer cytosols is well established; approximately 50% of ER-positive cases respond to endocrine therapy. Whether such a poor correlation is related to a high proportion of cleaved ER is a question of prime importance. Failure of routine ER assays to discriminate between full-length and cleaved receptors led us to develop an oestradiol-binding assay based on hydroxylapatite adsorption.</p><p>The aims of the present study were to demonstrate that hydroxylapatite adsorption assay easily identifies cleaved cytosolic ER forms and to assess the origin of such ER forms.</p></sec><sec><title>Method:</title><p>Breast cancer cytosols classified as ER-positive according to [<sup>3</sup>H]oestradiol-binding assay (dextran-coated charcoal [DCC]) were subjected to hydroxylapatite adsorption. ER isoforms covalently labeled with [<sup>125</sup>I]tamoxifen aziridine (TAZ) released from this matrix with 0.5 mol/l KCl were subsequently immunoprecipitated with a panel of monoclonal antibodies raised against various domains of ER (H222 [E], H226 [C] or ER1D5 [AB]) before being subjected to SDS-gel electrophoresis.</p><p>Three approaches were used to identify the origins of the cleaved ER forms: potential truncated ER-&#x003b1; messenger RNAs that may encode ER isoforms of low molecular weights (Northern blot assay) were sought by using ER-&#x003b1; full-length probe; heat treatment of tumour cytosols in the absence or presence of a cocktail of protease inhibitors was performed; and the molecular weight of intracellular ER molecules was determined by <italic>in situ</italic> [<sup>125</sup>I]TAZ-labelling, which minimizes ER proteolysis.</p><p>Breast cancer samples classified as ER-positive according to both biochemical (cytosolic DCC assay) and histochemical (ER1D5 monoclonal antibody) criteria were labelled with [<sup>3</sup>H]oestradiol and were subsequently subjected to hydroxylapatite adsorption. Hydroxylapatite extraction index (EI) is defined as a ratio of the specifically bound [<sup>3</sup>H]oestradiol released from the hydroxylapatite matrix with KCl to the total amount of the specifically bound [<sup>3</sup>H]oestradiol extracted successively with KCl and ethanol: EI= ([<sup>3</sup>H]oestradiol) [KCl] &#x000d7; 100/([<sup>3</sup>H]oestradiol) [KCl] + ([<sup>3</sup>H]oestradiol) [EtOH]. The EI was calculated for each cytosol in order to evaluate the amount of cleaved ER forms present. Persistence of adsorption ER to hydroxylapatite in the presence of KCl (low EI) and ER1D5 positivity established by immunohistochemistry are two independent criteria for the presence of amino-terminal ABC domains. We therefore assessed whether hydroxylapatite determinations performed on cytosols are related to immuno-histochemistry data.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Cytosol pools labelled with [<sup>125</sup>I]TAZ gave different electrophoretic patterns depending on the nature of the anti-ER monoclonal antibody used in the immunoprecipitation step preceding electrophoresis. The carboxyl-terminal-specific antibody H222 precipitated all ER isoforms (full-length 67 kDa ER, and cleavage products of 50 and 37-28 kDa), whereas the amino-terminal-specific antibodies H226 and ER1D5 precipitated only the full-length and a partially truncated isoform. Adsorption of this labelled cytosol pool onto hydroxylapatite with subsequent KCl extraction yielded ER isoforms with molecular weights between 37 and 28 kDa when immunoprecipitation of the elutes was carried out using H222. The absence of these isoforms after exposure of the elutes to H226 or ER1D5 demonstrated truncation of these isoforms at a site(s) downstream of ABC domains.</p><p>Total RNA from 46 tumours was exposed to ER-&#x003b1; full-length probe (Northern blot). All tumours expressed a full-length 6.6-kb ER mRNA; small-sized isoforms were not recorded. A good correlation resulted when amounts of 6.6-kb ER mRNA estimated by densitometry were compared with corresponding [<sup>3</sup>H]oestradiol-binding capacities (DCC assay), thereby rejecting the concept that low-molecular-weight isoforms were encoded by truncated ER mRNA.</p><p>We next investigated whether such isoforms might be generated by proteolysis. Cytosol samples of a series of breast tumours were labelled with [<sup>125</sup>I]TAZ in the presence of a cocktail of protease inhibitors. These inhibitors failed to maintain the full-length 67 kDa ER by SDS-PAGE. <italic>In situ</italic> [<sup>125</sup>I]TAZ-labelling of receptors associated with a protein extraction procedure minimizing their proteolysis displayed multi-bands electrophoretic patterns, almost identical to those found under conventional methods. Hence, ER molecular heterogeneity appears to result from an intracellular proteolysis. ER1D5 immunostaining scores (ISs) of a series of 15 tumours were significantly correlated with ER levels, as measured by hydroxylapatite assay of corresponding cytosols (total number of binding sites). Sequential extraction of bound [<sup>3</sup>H]oestradiol from hydroxylapatite with KCl and ethanol revealed an EI of over 30% in the large majority of these cytosols, indicating a high frequency of cleaved ER isoforms. Of note, no significant correlation between IS and EI data was recorded, suggesting that ABC and E domains are separated at high ionic strength, but are apparently held together within the cell nucleus in oligomeric structures.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion:</title><p>Endogenous proteolysis is a regulatory mechanism in many cellular processes, such as cell cycle progression and transcriptional regulation. The present data extend this concept to ER. Indeed, proteolysis-generated ER fragments appear to be held together within the cell in oligomeric structures. Because ER proteolysis is probably relevant to several oestrogen target tissues, we suggest that the protein environment, which differs among tissues, may be a factor of major importance in the formation of distinct oligomeric structures, which elicit specific biological responses. The possibility of heterogeneous association between cleaved ER and regulatory proteins might perhaps result in a spectrum of such transcriptional activities. In this context, we propose that a complementary hydroxylapatite extraction assay (EI assessment) should be added to the usual tests to identify ER-positive tumours. Such a complementary test would provide an estimate of the level of cleaved ER forms, which may have biological and/or clinical relevance.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>estrogen receptor domains</kwd><kwd>hydroxylapatite</kwd><kwd>immunohistochemistry</kwd><kwd>primary breast cancer</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>Assessment of the ER status in breast cancer samples is currently used to select patients for endocrine (tamoxifen) therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Biochemical determinations of receptor concentration are based on the measurement of the tritiated oestradiol-binding capacity of cytosol samples; immunoenzymatic measurements (Abbott's ER enzyme immunoassay) usually give similar data because they use monoclonal antibodies against epitopes that are localized at both edges of the hormone-binding domain (E domain) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Histochemical data established with various anti-ER monoclonal antibodies are in agreement with these biochemical assays, at least on a qualitative basis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Of note, histochemical determinations identify ER essentially in the cell nucleus, leading to the concept of a possible dissociation of nuclear oligomers with concomitant release of the receptor into the cytosol at the time of homogenization.</p><p>Approximately 50% of ER-positive breast cancers respond to endocrine therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. A defect in the synthesis and/or turnover of ER that leads to the emergence of altered receptors has been suggested as an explanation for this relatively poor correlation between treatment response and ER status [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. In agreement with this, we found that about two-thirds of [<sup>125</sup>I]oestradiol-labelled cytosolic ERs elute as low-molecular-weight isoforms (&#x02264; 37 kDa, by size exclusion FPLC) that fail to adsorb strongly to hydroxylapatite at high ionic strength [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>], a property ascribed to receptors that are devoid of amino-terminal ABC domains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>] required for transcription activity. ER proteolysis may lead to such a situation. Thus, a differential susceptibility of the hinge region (D domain) that separates such ABC domains from the hormone-binding domain to endoproteolytic cleavage has long been recognized [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]; whole hormone-binding domain itself also contains a few specific motifs that are accessible to proteolytic attacks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Of note, an oestradiol-inductible protease activity, which is detected in mouse reproductive tissues, has been reported to produce a cleaved ER that is devoid of its amino-terminal region, but which has a nuclear localization capacity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Hence, cleaved ER isoforms may maintain a regulatory activity at the genomic level.</p><p>The relevance of the molecular heterogeneity of ER in breast cancer is still a matter of controversy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Our observation that a given ER cleavage pattern is relevant to the whole tumour mass (ie various samples taken from a given patient usually display identical radiolabelled SDS-PAGE profiles when their receptor isoforms were labelled with [<sup>3</sup>H]TAZ [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]) accredit the analysis of this question. Whether ER degradation occurs within the cell or is a product of homogenization or assay is a question of prime interest, in view of recent data regarding the biological significance of intracellular proteolysis of transcriptional regulators, such as the nuclear factor-&#x003ba;B, p53, c-JUN, sterol-regulated element-binding proteins and MAT&#x003b1;2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. Of note, activation of nuclear factor-&#x003ba;B requires proteasome-dependent proteolysis, leading to the processing of a precursor (nuclear factor-&#x003ba;B1) into the mature form [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. Association of nuclear factor-&#x003ba;B with a specific inhibitory protein (I&#x003ba;B), which masks its nuclear localization signal, constitutes a functional system in which DNA binding/activation and regulatory/inhibitory functions are performed by two separate proteins that can interact [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. Similar association of distinct functional domains may be applicable to cleaved ER isoforms, because the native form is also subject to proteasomal degradation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>].</p><p>In the present paper we demonstrate that ER isoforms of low molecular weight could not be ascribed to the expression of truncated mRNAs, or to the proteolysis of the native peptide at the time of assay, suggesting a degradative mechanism at the intracellular level. Moreover, we establish systematic immunohistochemical identification of ER amino-terminal domains within the cell nucleus with an anti-ER monoclonal antibody (ER1D5) that is raised against this part of the receptor molecule. All of these findings support the concept of a potential intranuclear association between cleaved ER and other regulatory proteins.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Material and methods</title><sec><title>Reagents</title><p>[<sup>3</sup>H]oestradiol (approximately 100 Ci/mmol) was obtained from Amersham (Buckinghamshire, UK); [<sup>125</sup>I]TAZ (approximately 2000 Ci/mmol) was obtained from Trigone Ligands/Biocode (Li&#x000e8;ge, Belgium); and unlabelled oestradiol was obtained from Sigma (St Louis, MO, USA).

In view of the high frequency of cleaved ER isoforms in breast cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>], such domains should be dissociated at high ionic strength, as demonstrated here using [<sup>125</sup>I]TAZ as a labelling agent.</p><p>ER isoforms labelled with radiolabelled TAZ were easily detected by successive immunoprecipitation and SDS-PAGE (full-length 67 kDa and cleavage products of 50 and 37-28 kDa) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. Using this approach we observed that a pool of breast cancer cytosols labelled with [<sup>125</sup>I]TAZ gave different electrophoretic patterns, depending on the nature of the anti-ER monoclonal antibody used in the immunoprecipitation step preceding electrophoresis (H222, H226, ER1D5; Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3a</xref>, left). The carboxyl-terminal-specific antibody H222 precipitated all ER isoforms, whereas the amino-terminal-specific antibodies H226 and ER1D5 precipitated only the full-length and a partially truncated 50 kDa isoform, indicating a lack of corresponding antigenic sites in the 37-28 kDa isoforms. Of note, the 50 kDa band was more intensely labelled with H226. The [<sup>125</sup>I]TAZ-labelling intensity of all of these bands was suppressed with a 200-fold excess of unlabelled oestradiol, establishing their specificity.</p><p>Part of this [<sup>125</sup>I]TAZ-labelled cytosol pool was adsorbed onto hydroxylapatite and subsequently subjected to KCl extraction (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3a</xref>; right). Elutes were then immunoprecipitated before being subjected to SDS-PAGE. Absence of 67 and 50 kDa isoforms under all immunoprecipitation conditions confirmed their adherence onto hydroxylapatite due to their strong interaction (ABC domains) with the matrix. On the contrary, and as expected, ER isoforms with a molecular weight of between 37 and 28 kDa were detected in the elutes when the immunoprecipitation was carried out by H222; their absence after exposure to H226 or ER1D5 confirmed the cleavage of these isoforms at a site(s) downstream of ABC domains. Hence, hydroxylapatite extraction assay easily identifies ER isoforms that lack amino-termini. Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3b</xref> illustrates the presumed structure of these various ER isoforms, as well as their sizes as determined by SDS-PAGE.</p></sec><sec><title>Assessment of oestrogen receptor mRNA size in breast cancer</title><p>Total RMA from 46 breast tumours was qualitatively and quantitatively analyzed by hybridization with an ER-&#x003b1; full-length probe (Northern blotting). All tumours expressed a full-length 6.6-kb ER mRNA (small-sized species were not recorded). Moreover, a good correlation was obtained when the amount of 6.6-kb ER mRNA estimated by densitometry was compared with corresponding [<sup>3</sup>H]oestradiol-binding capacities (DCC values; Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). Hence, ER isoforms of low molecular weight did not appear to be encoded by truncated ER mRNAs, suggesting that they were generated by proteolysis. Whether such a phenomenon is an intracellular process is analyzed below.</p></sec><sec><title>Origin of cleaved oestrogen receptor forms</title><p>Cytosol samples of a series of breast tumours were labelled with [<sup>125</sup>I]TAZ in the presence of a cocktail of compounds that are known to inhibit the action of a wide range of proteolytic activities (final concentrations: 1 mmol/l for AEBSF, antipain and chymostatin; 5 mmol/l for PMSF; 0.1 mmol/l for leupeptin; and 0.1 mg/ml for calpastatin); this cocktail was added before or shortly after the homogenization of the samples. These inhibitors failed to maintain the native 67 kDa nature of the receptor as demonstrated by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>); the ER electrophoretic pattern was not significantly modified, still showing bands of low molecular weight.</p><p>In order to determine the molecular weight of intracellular ER molecules, we applied an <italic>in situ</italic> labelling approach along with an extraction procedure to minimize ER proteolysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]; tumour slices were incubated with [<sup>125</sup>I]TAZ at 37&#x000b0;C before homogenization and lysis at 100&#x000b0;C in the presence of SDS. Labelled proteins extracted with phenolic solution were precipitated by acetone and finally identified by SDS-PAGE. ER electrophoretic patterns remained almost identical to those usually found with cytosols, still showing bands of truncated receptors (mainly 50 and 37-28 kDa; Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>). Hence, the high proportion of the low-molecular-weight isoforms appeared already to be present within tumour samples.</p><p>Finally, breast cancer cytosols were heated at 37&#x000b0;C for 2 min in the absence or presence of a cocktail of protease inhibitors in order to determine whether they possess proteolytic activities that are able to cleave native ER. Samples were subsequently adsorbed onto hydroxylapatite and successively subjected to KCl and ethanol extraction. No significant increase in EI was recorded (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>); inhibitors also failed to induce any drastic change in EI values, refuting the hypothesis that isoforms devoid of ABC domains may emerge during assay procedures. Of note, treatment at 37&#x000b0;C of control preparations of native ER (human recombinant ER, MCF-7 cells) resulted in similar behaviour. Hence, major proteolysis did not occur at the time of manipulation. Taken together, these data suggest that dominant ER proteolytic cleavage is an intracellular process.</p></sec><sec><title>Hydroxylapatite extraction index and heterogeneity of oestrogen receptors</title><p>Data reported here clearly show that low-molecular-weight ER isoforms extracted from hydroxylapatite matrix with KCl were not recognized by the ER1D5 monoclonal antibody. Because this antibody is often used in immunohistochemical assessment of ERs, we assessed whether immunohistochemical data are related to hydroxylapatite ER adsorption characteristics measured in cytosolic preparations from the corresponding tumours. For this purpose, cytosols from a set of 15 ER-positive tumours (by DCC assay), for which nuclear ERs had been detected by immunohistochemistry (IS cutoff &#x02265; 5), were labelled with [<sup>3</sup>H]oestradiol and were then subjected to hydroxylapatite assay (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">3</xref>).

Sequential extraction of bound [<sup>3</sup>H]oestradiol from hydroxylapatite with KCl and ethanol revealed an EI of over 30% in the large majority of these cytosols (11/15), indicating a high frequency of cleaved ER. Of note, no significant correlation between IS and EI data (<italic>r</italic> = 0.2; <italic>P</italic> &#x0003e; 0.05) was detected, clearly establishing that identification of ABC domains within the cell (indicated by IS) does not imply the presence of (native) full-length ER in the corresponding cytosol.</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Comparison of [<sup>3</sup>H]oestradiol (E<sub>2</sub>)-binding capacities of a series of human breast cancer cytosols simultaneously measured by DCC and hydroxylapatite (HAP) assays (ethanolic extraction).

On limited digestion, ER fragments of 50 and 37 kDa and lower molecular weight were recorded in uterine cytosol preparations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>]. The presence of such isoforms has generally been attributed to proteolysis of the native ER [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>]. Regarding ER prepared from breast cancer samples, we previously suggested [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>] that proteolytic events that operate at the time of tissue processing might explain the observed extreme ER molecular heterogeneity. Data presented here clearly refute this hypothesis. A high proportion of these isoforms is derived from an intracellular proteolytic activity, as shown by electrophoresis of <italic>in situ</italic>  [<sup>125</sup>I]TAZ-labelled ER and addition of protease inhibitors to cytosols. In this regard, the present results are in agreement with those reported recently by Navarro <italic>et al</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>] who demonstrated that the inclusion of PMSF, aprotinin and leupeptin to human uterine cytosolic ER did not prevent the 8S to 4S transformation known to be associated with ER cleavage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>]. Hence, truncated ER isoforms are probably produced before contact with protease inhibitors.</p><p>On breast tumour slices, staining intensities (ISs) established with the ER1D5 monoclonal antibody used here have often been reported to be correlated with [<sup>3</sup>H]oestradiol binding capacities of corresponding cytosolic extracts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>]. Hence, a consensus seems to exist between immunohistochemical detection of the amino-terminal region of ER (ABC domains) and biochemical measurement of its carboxyl-terminal region (E domain). In agreement with this, we reported a significant correlation between immunohistochemical data and [<sup>3</sup>H]oestradiol-binding capacities measured by hydroxylapatite assay; ABC domains are indeed required for hydroxylapatite adsorption [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. For both [<sup>3</sup>H]oestradiol- and [<sup>125</sup>I]TAZ labelled-ER isoforms, we found an excellent correlation between DCC values and hydroxylapatite adsorption data, suggesting the concomitant presence of free ABC and E domains in most cytosols (proteolytic fragments physically separated from each other at high ionic strength; high EI values). Hence, these domains would be held together within the cell nucleus because of the tendency of the receptor to be included into oligomeric structures. Corroborating these views of intracellular association between ER fragments, Fritsch <italic>et al</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>] described large oligomeric complexes containing proteolysis-generated ER fragments in rat uterus.</p><p>When expressed individually as separate polypeptides in ER-negative breast cancer cells (MDA-MB-231), neither ABCD (AF-1 containing) nor EF (AF-2 containing) domains activated transcription from a hormone-inducible reporter gene (<italic>3ERE-pS2-CAT</italic>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>]. Coexpression of the steroid receptor coactivator-1 protein with either ABCD or EF alone was also ineffective [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>]. On the contrary, when expressed together, amino- and carboxyl-terminal ER regions interacted in an oestradiol-dependent manner to reconstitute ER transcriptional activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>]. In this context, it should be emphasized that steroid receptor coactivator-1 has also been suggested to promote the association between separate amino- and carboxyl-terminal regions of ER, allowing full ER activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>]. In view of these data, one may speculate that the secondary and tertiary structures of the receptor peptide required for its transcriptional ability would not be lost when it has been subjected to endogenous proteolytic activity. Hence, intracellular ER fragmentation should not necessarily imply lack of transcriptional activity.</p><p>Endogenous proteolysis is a mechanism of regulation of many cellular processes, such as cell cycle progression and transcriptional regulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>]. Recent data concerning cell-specific regulation of oestrogen target gene expression in various rat tissues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>] and cell lines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>] demonstrated different levels of coactivators and corepressors. Hence, protein environment would be a factor of major importance in the ability of ER to transcribe genes. Although not presently demonstrated in breast cancer, the possibility of heterogeneous association between cleavage products of ER and other regulatory proteins could be proposed, generating a situation that may mimic the behaviour of chimaeric receptors. Thus, domain-swapping experiments in which the ER amino-terminal domain was switched with that of the glucocorticoid receptor yielded a receptor that upregulates transcription of glucocorticoid-responsive target genes when treated with oestradiol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>]. Investigation of homogenous association and/or heterogeneous association between cleaved ER regions and regulatory proteins would be informative with regard to the validity of this hypothesis.</p><p>In view of these considerations, it seems that analysis of the biological role and potential clinical relevance of endogenous ER proteolysis is of prime importance. The hydroxylapatite extraction assay described here, which is extremely simple, would provide a criteria for the detection of tumours characterized by a high amount of full-length ER (low EI). Such tumours may perhaps be considered an indication for adjuvant hormone therapy if we refer to earlier sucrose gradient sedimentation data concerning hormone dependency of tumours that express native and/or cleaved ER forms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]; very high EI may perhaps be an index of poor prognosis. In practice, for clinical correlation studies devoted to analysis of these hypotheses, we propose that a hydroxylapatite extraction assay should be performed as a complement to the usual immunohistochemical test (or Abbott's ER enzyme immunoassay [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]), in view of the small size of most tumours that restrict the cytosol amount. If our speculations concerning the biological/clinical relevance of the detection of cleaved ER isoforms are verified, then the introduction of such a hydroxylapatite assay into routine practice would be helpful to orientate therapy.</p></sec></body><back><ack><sec><title>Acknowledgement</title><p>This work was supported by grants from the Fonds Medic and the Fonds J-C Heuson.
