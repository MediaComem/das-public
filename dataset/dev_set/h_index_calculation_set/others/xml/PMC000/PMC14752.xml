This checkpoint delays mitosis until damaged DNA is repaired. Chk1 regulates the activity and localization of Cdc25, the tyrosine phosphatase that activates the cdk Cdc2. Here we report that Mik1, a tyrosine kinase that inhibits Cdc2, is positively regulated by the DNA damage checkpoint. Mik1 is required for checkpoint response in strains that lack Cdc25. Long-term DNA damage checkpoint arrest fails in <italic>&#x00394;mik1</italic> cells. DNA damage increases Mik1 abundance in a Chk1-dependent manner. Ubiquitinated Mik1 accumulates in a proteasome mutant, which indicates that Mik1 normally has a short half-life. Thus, the DNA damage checkpoint might regulate Mik1 degradation. Mik1 protein and mRNA oscillate during the unperturbed cell cycle, with peak amounts detected around S phase. These data indicate that regulation of Mik1 abundance helps to couple mitotic onset to the completion of DNA replication and repair. Coordinated negative regulation of Cdc25 and positive regulation of Mik1 ensure the effective operation of the DNA damage checkpoint.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>In response to DNA damage or incomplete DNA synthesis, eukaryotic cells delay the onset of mitosis by activation of mitotic checkpoints (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">Hartwell and Weinert, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">Elledge, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">Rhind and Russell, 1998a</xref>). These checkpoints enhance genome integrity by ensuring that chromosomes are fully replicated and repaired before nuclear division. Genomic instability arising from checkpoint defects may lead to cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">Hartwell, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">Hartwell and Kastan, 1994</xref>). Moreover, checkpoints influence the response of tumor cells to radiotherapy and chemotherapy protocols that damage DNA or inhibit DNA replication. Thus, understanding checkpoint mechanisms is a major priority of current studies that investigate cell cycle control or cancer.</p><p>Fundamental insights into DNA damage checkpoints have arisen from studies of the fission yeast <italic>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">Russell, 1998</xref>). Chk1, a protein kinase that is essential for DNA damage checkpoint arrest, was discovered in fission yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">Walworth <italic>et al.</italic>, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">al-Khodairy <italic>et al.</italic>, 1994</xref>). Chk1 functions downstream of a group of &#x0201c;checkpoint Rad&#x0201d; proteins that includes Rad1, Rad3, Rad9, Rad17, Rad26, and Hus1. The functions of checkpoint Rad proteins are poorly understood, as is the regulation of Chk1. However, it is known that DNA damage stimulates Chk1 phosphorylation by a process that requires the checkpoint Rad proteins Rad4/Cut5 and Rhp9/Crb2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">Saka and Yanagida, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">Walworth and Bernards, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">Saka <italic>et al.</italic>, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">Willson <italic>et al.</italic>, 1997</xref>). Cdc2, the cdk that triggers mitosis, is the ultimate target of checkpoint regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">Rhind <italic>et al.</italic>, 1997</xref>). Cdc2 is inhibited by phosphorylation on tyrosine 15 catalyzed by the protein kinases Wee1 and Mik1. Cdc25, the tyrosine phosphatase that activates Cdc2, is an important substrate of Chk1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">Furnari <italic>et al.</italic>, 1997a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">Peng <italic>et al.</italic>, 1997</xref>). Chk1 regulates Cdc25 by two mechanisms. One mechanism is direct inhibition of Cdc25 phosphatase activity directed toward Cdc2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">Blasina <italic>et al.</italic>, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">Furnari <italic>et al.</italic>, 1999</xref>). The second mechanism involves stimulated association with 14-3-3 proteins, such as Rad24 in fission yeast, which leads to net nuclear export of Cdc25 and consequent exclusion from the nuclear pool of Cdc2/cyclin B (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">Lopez-Girona <italic>et al.</italic>, 1999</xref>).</p><p>The checkpoint Rad proteins, but not Chk1 or Crb2, are required for S&#x02013;M replication checkpoint. This checkpoint prevents mitosis when DNA replication is slowed, e.g., with the drug hydroxyurea, an inhibitor of ribonucleotide reductase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">al-Khodairy and Carr, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">Walworth <italic>et al.</italic>, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">al-Khodairy <italic>et al.</italic>, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">Saka <italic>et al.</italic>, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">Willson <italic>et al.</italic>, 1997</xref>). The protein kinase Cds1, instead of Chk1, functions downstream of checkpoint Rad proteins to enforce the S&#x02013;M checkpoint (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">Murakami and Okayama, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">Boddy <italic>et al.</italic>, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">Lindsay <italic>et al.</italic>, 1998</xref>). Like the DNA damage checkpoint (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">Rhind <italic>et al.</italic>, 1997</xref>), the S&#x02013;M replication checkpoint prevents mitosis by maintaining Cdc2 in an inhibited, tyrosine phosphorylated state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">Enoch and Nurse, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">Rhind and Russell, 1998b</xref>). In a manner similar to Chk1, Cds1 phosphorylates and thereby inhibits Cdc25 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">Zeng <italic>et al.</italic>, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">Furnari <italic>et al.</italic>, 1999</xref>). Cds1 is also required for the large accumulation of Mik1 protein that occurs in hydroxyurea-treated cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">Boddy <italic>et al.</italic>, 1998</xref>). It is thought that inhibition of Cdc25 function and accumulation of Mik1 both contribute to enforcement of the replication checkpoint.</p><p>Checkpoint mechanisms uncovered in studies of <italic>S. pombe</italic> appear to be conserved among most eukaryotes, including humans. DNA database searches have identified human homologues of <italic>chk1</italic><sup>&#x0002b;</sup> and <italic>cds1</italic><sup>&#x0002b;</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">Sanchez <italic>et al.</italic>, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">Matsuoka <italic>et al.</italic>, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">Blasina <italic>et al.</italic>, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">Brown <italic>et al.</italic>, 1999</xref>). These homologues inhibit Cdc25 and become activated or hyperphosphorylated in response to DNA damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">Sanchez <italic>et al.</italic>, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">Matsuoka <italic>et al.</italic>, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">Blasina <italic>et al.</italic>, 1999</xref>). Moreover, DNA damage in human cells leads to inhibition of Cdc25 activity by a process that requires ATM, a kinase related to Rad3 in fission yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">Blasina <italic>et al.</italic>, 1999</xref>). In mammalian or <italic>Xenopus</italic> cells grown in culture, nuclear exclusion of Cdc25 requires association with 14-3-3 proteins, an observation that suggests a potential checkpoint role for 14-3-3 proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">Dalal <italic>et al.</italic>, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">Kumagai and Dunphy, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">Yang <italic>et al.</italic>, 1999</xref>). In <italic>Xenopus</italic> egg extracts, activation of the DNA replication checkpoint induces stabilization of exogenous Wee1 added to the extract (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">Michael and Newport, 1998</xref>), an observation similar to that of Mik1 accumulation in fission yeast cells treated with hydroxyurea (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">Boddy <italic>et al.</italic>, 1998</xref>).</p><p>Regulation of Cdc25 by Chk1 appears to be very important for the DNA damage checkpoint. However, this fact does not exclude the possibility that the Cdc2-directed kinases Wee1 and Mik1 might be regulated in a positive manner by the DNA damage checkpoint. Indeed, Wee1 appears to be hyperphosphorylated in UV-irradiated cells, although the significance of this phosphorylation is unknown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">O'Connell <italic>et al.</italic>, 1997</xref>). Here we report that Mik1 is regulated by the DNA damage checkpoint. Genetic and physiological evidence shows that Mik1 is important for maintenance of the DNA damage checkpoint and that Mik1 protein abundance increases in cells arrested at the checkpoint. Mik1 also accumulates in the nucleus during an unperturbed S phase. These data indicate that Mik1 regulation helps to ensure that the onset of mitosis is coupled to the completion of DNA replication during the normal cell cycle or completion of DNA repair in cells that have suffered DNA damage.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>General Methods</title><p>Genetic and biochemical methods for studying fission yeast were used as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">Moreno <italic>et al.</italic>, 1991</xref>). All strains were grown in yeast extract&#x02013;glucose medium at 30&#x000b0;C unless indicated otherwise.

Cells were scored for progression through mitosis by microscopic observation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">Rhind <italic>et al.</italic>, 1997</xref>). Indirect immunofluorescence studies were performed as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">Lopez-Girona <italic>et al.</italic>, 1999</xref>).

Blots were probed with mouse mAbs to the Myc epitope (9E10; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) or the PSTAIR peptide derived from Cdc2. Primary antibodies were detected with the use of an HRP-conjugated anti-mouse immunoglobulin G antibody (Promega, Madison, WI) and Luminol reagents (<named-content content-type="company" xlink:href="pierce">Pierce</named-content>, Rockford, IL).

Cdc25 is normally essential for division, but the <italic>cdc2-3w</italic> mutation, which is a dominant activating allele, bypasses the requirement for Cdc25 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">Russell and Nurse, 1986</xref>). Cells that have the <italic>cdc2-3w</italic> mutation divide at a cell length of &#x0223c;8 &#x003bc;m, whereas <italic>cdc2-3w &#x00394;cdc25</italic> cells divide at &#x0223c;18 &#x003bc;m. These facts are consistent with the observation that DNA damage, which leads to inhibition of Cdc25, causes a substantial checkpoint delay in <italic>cdc2-3w</italic> cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">Sheldrick and Carr, 1993</xref>). Importantly, Cdc2 protein encoded by <italic>cdc2-3w</italic> is responsive to changes in the activity of kinases that phosphorylate Cdc2 on tyrosine 15 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">Russell and Nurse, 1987b</xref>). A synchronous population of <italic>cdc2-3w &#x00394;cdc25</italic> cells in G<sub>2</sub> phase was collected by centrifugal elutriation and immediately exposed to 200 Gy of ionizing radiation or mock treated. Irradiation caused an &#x0223c;45-min mitotic delay relative to the unirradiated control (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>A). These findings showed that the DNA damage checkpoint is partially retained in <italic>cdc2-3w &#x00394;cdc25</italic> cells. To determine if Chk1 is required for this mitotic delay, a <italic>cdc2-3w &#x00394;cdc25 &#x00394;chk1</italic> culture was analyzed by the same experimental protocol (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>B). The <italic>&#x00394;chk1</italic> mutation eliminated the mitotic delay induced by irradiation. The DNA damage checkpoint is abolished in cells that are unable to phosphorylate Cdc2 on tyrosine 15 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">Rhind <italic>et al.</italic>, 1997</xref>). Therefore, these data suggested that Chk1 must regulate Wee1 or Mik1, the kinases that phosphorylate Cdc2 on tyrosine 15.  </p></sec><sec><title>Mik1 Is Important for Division Arrest Induced by GST&#x02013;Chk1 Overproduction</title><p>Expression of large amounts of GST&#x02013;Chk1 fusion protein causes cell cycle arrest, mimicking a damage-induced checkpoint arrest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">Rhind <italic>et al.</italic>, 1997</xref>). This phenotype also occurs in a <italic>&#x00394;wee1</italic> strain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">Furnari <italic>et al.</italic>, 1997a</xref>). To confirm that Chk1 is able to delay mitosis independently of Cdc25 and Wee1, GST&#x02013;Chk1 was overproduced under the control of the thiamine-repressible <italic>nmt1</italic> promoter in a <italic>wee1-50 &#x00394;cdc25</italic> strain. These cells were grown at 35&#x000b0;C, a restrictive temperature that inactivates <italic>wee1-50</italic> gene product. Remarkably, GST&#x02013;Chk1 overexpression caused cell cycle arrest in <italic>wee1-50 &#x00394;cdc25</italic> cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>A). These data implicated Mik1 as a target of Chk1 regulation.  </p><p>To test the possibility that Mik1 is regulated by Chk1, a copy of the <italic>nmt1:GST-chk1</italic><sup>&#x0002b;</sup> construct was integrated in a <italic>&#x00394;mik1</italic> strain. Induction of GST&#x02013;Chk1 expression induced cell elongation but failed to cause cell cycle arrest in <italic>&#x00394;mik1</italic> cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>B). In fact, <italic>&#x00394;mik1</italic> cells formed viable colonies in medium that induces GST&#x02013;Chk1 expression (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>C). In contrast, overproduction of GST&#x02013;Chk1 caused cell cycle arrest in wild-type and <italic>wee1-50</italic> cells incubated at 32&#x000b0;C (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>) and in <italic>&#x00394;wee1</italic> cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">Furnari <italic>et al.</italic>, 1997a</xref>).

A synchronous population of cells in G<sub>2</sub> phase collected by centrifugal elutriation was exposed to the radiomimetic drug bleomycin, which causes DNA double-strand breaks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">Kostrub <italic>et al.</italic>, 1997</xref>). Bleomycin-treated <italic>&#x00394;mik1</italic> cells exhibited a mitotic delay of &#x0223c;100 min relative to mock-treated <italic>&#x00394;mik1</italic> or wild-type cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>A). Unlike wild-type cells, <italic>&#x00394;mik1</italic> cells were unable to maintain a checkpoint arrest. In the continuous presence of bleomycin, all of the <italic>&#x00394;mik1</italic> cells completed mitosis by 240 min, whereas fewer than 10&#x00025; of wild-type cells had undergone mitosis by 320 min (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>A). These findings demonstrated that Mik1 is required for a prolonged DNA damage checkpoint arrest.  </p><p>Independent confirmation of the importance of Mik1 in the DNA damage checkpoint was provided by examination of the checkpoint response in a <italic>cdc2-3w &#x00394;cdc25 &#x00394;mik1</italic> strain.

The irradiated and mock-treated cultures completed mitosis with similar kinetics. These findings contrast with the behavior of <italic>cdc2-3w &#x00394;cdc25</italic> cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>), in which irradiation caused a substantial delay of mitosis by a Chk1-dependent process. These studies supported the proposition that Mik1 is in some way positively regulated by Chk1.</p></sec><sec><title>Cell Cycle Regulation of Nuclear Mik1</title><p>Cellular localization of the mitotic activator, Cdc25, changes in response to DNA damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">Lopez-Girona <italic>et al.</italic>, 1999</xref>). This precedence prompted investigations of Mik1 localization in cells that have suffered DNA damage. Before undertaking these studies, we examined the localization of Mik1 during the normal cell cycle with the use of a strain that expressed a myc-tagged form of Mik1 (<italic>mik1:13Myc</italic>) from the <italic>mik1</italic><sup>&#x0002b;</sup> genomic locus. These cells underwent division at a normal size, and <italic>wee1-50 mik1:13Myc</italic> cells were viable at 36&#x000b0;C (our unpublished data); therefore, the myc-tagged form of Mik1 appeared to be fully functional. Mik1 was detected in the nucleus of binucleate cells and small cells that had recently completed cell division (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>A). G<sub>1</sub> phase is normally very short in fission yeast; thus, DNA replication ensues almost immediately after nuclear division and is essentially complete when daughter cells have detached. Therefore, the nuclear staining pattern of Mik1 corresponds to S phase and early G<sub>2</sub>.  </p><p>The cytoplasmic signal detected in the myc-tagged Mik1 strain was comparable to the background signal observed in the untagged control strain (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>A). This observation suggested that the periodic nuclear detection of Mik1 was determined by changes in protein abundance, as opposed to regulation of Mik1 subcellular localization. This hypothesis was tested by immunoblot measurements of Mik1 abundance in a synchronous cell culture. A temperature-sensitive <italic>cdc25-22</italic> strain was arrested in late G<sub>2</sub> phase by incubation at restrictive temperature, followed by a shift to permissive temperature, which caused synchronous resumption of cell cycle progression. Immunoblot analysis showed that Mik1 protein abundance oscillated during the cell cycle, with the peak signal coinciding with maximum septation index (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>B). This pattern corresponds most closely to S phase in a <italic>cdc25-22</italic> arrest-and-release experiment. Northern blot analysis demonstrated that <italic>mik1</italic><sup>&#x0002b;</sup> mRNA abundance also oscillated during the cell cycle, with the peak signal occurring immediately before the maximum immunoblot signal for Mik1 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>B). Thus, the nuclear localization of Mik1 during S and early G<sub>2</sub> phases correlated with the appearance of <italic>mik1</italic><sup>&#x0002b;</sup> mRNA and protein.</p></sec><sec><title>Mik1 Accumulation Induced by Checkpoints</title><p>Immunofluorescence studies were performed to monitor Mik1 localization in cells arrested at DNA replication or damage checkpoints. These experiments used <italic>mik1:13Myc</italic> cells incubated for 4 h in 10 mM hydroxyurea (HU) or 2.5 mU of bleomycin (BL). Activation of the DNA replication checkpoint by hydroxyurea caused accumulation of Mik1 in the nucleus (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>A). Essentially all cells treated with hydroxyurea displayed a nuclear Mik1 signal, whereas in asynchronous cultures only binucleate or septated cells in S, or short cells in early G<sub>2</sub>, presented a Mik1 signal in the nucleus. The Mik1 signal in hydroxyurea-arrested cells was much more intense than that observed in asynchronous cells that were in S phase. The intense nuclear signal of Mik1 in hydroxyurea-arrested cells accords with previous immunoblot studies that demonstrated dramatic accumulation of Mik1 protein in cells arrested at the S&#x02013;M replication checkpoint (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">Boddy <italic>et al.</italic>, 1998</xref>). These studies also showed that hydroxyurea-induced accumulation was largely dependent on Rad3 and Cds1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">Boddy <italic>et al.</italic>, 1998</xref>). In agreement with the previous immunoblot studies, the Mik1 nuclear signal was substantially reduced in hydroxyurea-treated <italic>&#x00394;rad3</italic> or <italic>&#x00394;cds1</italic> cells relative the wild-type counterparts (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>, B and C). The <italic>&#x00394;rad3</italic> cells failed to arrest in hydroxyurea and instead entered mitosis with incompletely replicated DNA. This checkpoint defect accounts for the large number of septated <italic>&#x00394;rad3</italic> cells in which DNA, visualized with the stain DAPI, is unequally segregated to the daughter cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>B). As predicted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">Boddy <italic>et al.</italic>, 1998</xref>), the hydroxyurea-induced nuclear accumulation of Mik1 was undiminished in <italic>&#x00394;chk1</italic> cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>D)  </p><p>The asynchronous culture of <italic>&#x00394;rad3</italic> cells presented a Mik1 staining pattern that was generally similar to that in wild-type cells, i.e., the Mik1 nuclear signal was strongest in binucleate or septated cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>B, left panels). This pattern indicated that the normal periodicity of Mik1 mRNA and protein accumulation during S and early G<sub>2</sub> was not dependent on Rad3. Likewise, unperturbed <italic>&#x00394;cds1</italic> or <italic>&#x00394;chk1</italic> cells displayed a Mik1 staining pattern that was very similar to that in wild-type cells. Interestingly, it appeared that an increased fraction of the uninucleate cells in the asynchronous <italic>&#x00394;rad3</italic> culture displayed a detectable Mik1 nuclear signal, relative to uninucleate wild-type cells. This observation might indicate that <italic>&#x00394;rad3</italic> cells spend a longer period of the cell cycle in S phase, perhaps as a result of heretofore unrecognized problems with DNA replication.</p><p>Upon activation of the DNA damage checkpoint by bleomycin, wild-type cells arrest in G<sub>2</sub>, a period in the cell cycle in which Mik1 protein is not detected by immunofluorescence (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). Interestingly, Mik1 nuclear staining was clearly visible in cells treated with bleomycin (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>A). This signal was quite evident but was substantially less strong than that observed with wild-type cells arrested with hydroxyurea. A large fraction of the <italic>&#x00394;rad3</italic> or <italic>&#x00394;chk1</italic> cells treated with bleomycin had no nuclear Mik1 signal, the exceptions being mostly septated, binucleate, or shorter uninucleate cells that were presumably in S or early G<sub>2</sub> (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>, B and D). This pattern was particularly evident in the <italic>&#x00394;chk1</italic> cells. The <italic>&#x00394;cds1</italic> cells treated with bleomycin appeared very similar to wild-type counterparts, a finding that is consistent with the notion that Cds1 has no significant role in the DNA damage checkpoint. An immunoblot experiment was performed to confirm that bleomycin induces the accumulation of Mik1 to a level greater than that found in asynchronous cells but less than the amount found in cells treated with hydroxyurea (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>E)</p><p>Thus, DNA damage inflicted by bleomycin induced the accumulation of Mik1 by a process dependent on Rad3 and Chk1. These findings substantially strengthened evidence that Mik1 is specifically regulated by the DNA damage checkpoint.</p></sec><sec><title>Mik1 Nuclear Accumulation Induced by DNA Damage in Prearrested G<sub>2</sub> Cells</title><p>An experiment was performed to determine if the accumulation of Mik1 induced by bleomycin was a specific consequence of the DNA damage checkpoint, as opposed to prolonged arrest in G<sub>2</sub>. A culture of <italic>cdc25-22 mik1:13Myc</italic> cells was arrested in G<sub>2</sub> by incubation at restrictive temperature. Nuclear accumulation of Mik1 was not detected in these cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>). However, when bleomycin was added after the shift to restrictive temperature, <italic>cdc25-22 mik1:13Myc</italic> cells exhibited Mik1 nuclear staining. Cells of the same genetic background that also contained the <italic>&#x00394;chk1</italic> or <italic>&#x00394;rad3</italic> allele failed to accumulate Mik1 when treated with bleomycin after a shift to restrictive temperature (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>). These results demonstrated that nuclear accumulation of Mik1 induced by bleomycin was caused by activation of the damage checkpoint and was not simply a result of the G<sub>2</sub> arrest. Thus, nuclear accumulation of Mik1 appeared to be a cause instead of a consequence of the G<sub>2</sub> arrest induced by DNA damage.  </p></sec><sec><title>Increased mik1 mRNA during Replication but Not Damage Checkpoint</title><p>Nuclear accumulation of Mik1 during S and early G<sub>2</sub> of the unperturbed cell cycle correlated with the appearance of <italic>mik1</italic> mRNA (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). Northern blot experiments were performed to determine if checkpoint-induced accumulation of Mik1 protein also correlated with changes in the abundance of <italic>mik1</italic> mRNA. These experiments were performed with wild-type or <italic>&#x00394;rad3</italic> cells exposed to hydroxyurea or bleomycin. A substantial increase in <italic>mik1</italic><sup>&#x0002b;</sup> mRNA was detected in wild-type cells treated with hydroxyurea (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>). These cells were arrested in S, the phase of the cell cycle in which <italic>mik1</italic><sup>&#x0002b;</sup> mRNA is most abundant in cycling cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). Earlier unpublished studies indicated that <italic>mik1</italic><sup>&#x0002b;</sup> mRNA was unchanged in hydroxyurea-arrested cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">Boddy <italic>et al.</italic>, 1998</xref>), but this finding was erroneous, perhaps because of the paucity of <italic>mik1</italic><sup>&#x0002b;</sup> mRNA. Importantly, <italic>mik1</italic><sup>&#x0002b;</sup> mRNA was unchanged in cells arrested in G<sub>2</sub> with bleomycin (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>). Thus, the bleomycin-induced accumulation of nuclear Mik1 was apparently not caused by enhanced expression or stabilization of <italic>mik1</italic><sup>&#x0002b;</sup> mRNA.  </p></sec><sec><title>Accumulation of Polyubiquitinated Mik1 in a Proteasome Mutant</title><p>The rapid disappearance of Mik1 upon exit from S phase in cycling cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>) suggested that Mik1 protein might normally have a short half-life. As a first step in the exploration of this possibility, an experiment was performed to determine if Mik1 is stabilized in cells that have the temperature-sensitive <italic>mts3-1</italic> mutation. Mts3 is an essential component of the 26S proteasome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">Gordon <italic>et al.</italic>, 1996</xref>). Incubation of this strain at the restrictive temperature led to a large increase of Mik1:13Myc protein (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref>A). To determine if Mik1 protein turnover might be mediated by polyubiquitination, this experiment was repeated in a strain that produced a hexahistidine-tagged form of ubiquitin. Hexahistidine proteins were purified with Ni<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>-nitrilotriacetic acid agarose and immunoblotted with antibodies to the myc epitope. Samples prepared from <italic>mts3-1</italic> cells yielded a substantial amount of Mik1:13Myc protein, whereas only a very weak Mik1:13Myc signal was detected in the sample from wild-type cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref>B). Most of this protein migrated in a broad range that is substantially larger than that of unmodified Mik1:13Myc protein, which indicated that Mik1:13Myc was most likely polyubiquitinated. These data indicated that Mik1 is rapidly degraded by ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis and suggested that checkpoints might induce Mik1 accumulation by stabilization of Mik1 protein.  </p></sec></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><sec><title>Role of Mik1 in the DNA Damage Checkpoint</title><p>Genetic and biochemical studies established that Cdc25 is a target of negative regulation by Chk1. Mutational inactivation of Cdc25 prevents the onset of mitosis. Chk1, therefore, could theoretically enforce a DNA damage checkpoint solely by inhibition of Cdc25. Our goal was to determine if Cdc25 is the only important target of the DNA damage checkpoint. Our findings argue against this hypothesis. These studies strongly suggest that positive regulation of Mik1 plays a significant role in the DNA damage checkpoint.</p><p>Cdc25 is normally essential for mitosis, but some strains are viable without Cdc25. The genotype of one such strain is <italic>cdc2-3w &#x00394;cdc25</italic>. How <italic>cdc2-3w</italic> suppresses <italic>&#x00394;cdc25</italic> is unknown; Cdc2 encoded by <italic>cdc2-3w</italic> is inhibited by tyrosine 15 phosphorylation catalyzed by Wee1 or Mik1. In fact, <italic>cdc2-3w wee1-50</italic> cells undergo premature lethal mitosis (&#x0201c;mitotic catastrophe&#x0201d;) at restrictive temperature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">Russell and Nurse, 1987b</xref>). We found that DNA damage causes a substantial mitotic delay in <italic>cdc2-3w &#x00394;cdc25</italic> cells. This defect was not obvious with static analysis of asynchronous cultures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">Furnari <italic>et al.</italic>, 1997)</xref>, but it was readily detected by careful analysis of synchronous cultures. This delay was abolished by <italic>&#x00394;chk1</italic> or <italic>&#x00394;mik1</italic> mutations, a result consistent with a model in which positive regulation of Mik1 by Chk1 helps to enforce the DNA damage checkpoint.</p><p>Deletion of <italic>cdc25</italic><sup>&#x0002b;</sup> is also suppressed by <italic>wee1-50</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">Russell and Nurse, 1986</xref>). We found that GST&#x02013;Chk1 overproduction arrests division in <italic>wee1-50 &#x00394;cdc25</italic> cells. This observation provided further indications that Chk1 regulates Mik1, because GST&#x02013;Chk1 overproduction cannot arrest division in <italic>wee1-50 &#x00394;mik1</italic> cells or in cells that express Cdc2-F15, a form of Cdc2 that cannot be phosphorylated by Wee1 or Mik1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">Rhind <italic>et al.</italic>, 1997a</xref>). The hypothesis that Chk1 regulates Mik1 was explored in more detail by determining if the <italic>&#x00394;mik1</italic> mutation impairs division arrest induced by GST&#x02013;Chk1 overproduction. Surprisingly, division arrest induced by GST&#x02013;Chk1 was suppressed by <italic>&#x00394;mik1</italic> but not by <italic>wee1-50</italic> (as shown here) or <italic>&#x00394;wee1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">Furnari <italic>et al.</italic>, 1997a</xref>). These findings are remarkable because Wee1 is presumed to contribute the bulk of kinase activity that phosphorylates Cdc2 on tyrosine 15 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">Lundgren <italic>et al.</italic>, 1991</xref>). Mutational inactivation of Wee1 but not Mik1 causes a wee phenotype and suppresses <italic>cdc25</italic> loss-of-function mutations. These findings suggested that Mik1 but not Wee1 is a target of Chk1-mediated division arrest.</p><p>How does <italic>&#x00394;mik1</italic> rescue division arrest caused by enzymatic inactivation of Cdc25 catalyzed by GST&#x02013;Chk1 but not mutational inactivation of Cdc25, whereas <italic>wee1</italic> mutations have the opposite effect? An answer is provided by a model in which Chk1 increases Mik1 abundance. If Chk1 simultaneously inhibits Cdc25 function and increases Mik1 abundance, then <italic>wee1</italic><sup>&#x02212;</sup> mutations could be insufficient to suppress enzymatic inactivation of Cdc25. Mutational inactivation of Cdc25 is not accompanied by enhanced Mik1 abundance. A related question is the following: why is the <italic>&#x00394;mik1</italic> mutation sufficient to suppress enzymatic inactivation of Cdc25 catalyzed by GST&#x02013;Chk1 but not mutational inactivation of Cdc25? Two explanations come readily to mind. Cdc25 might be more severely inhibited by mutations compared with GST&#x02013;Chk1 overproduction. Hence, <italic>&#x00394;mik1</italic> might be sufficient to rescue Chk1-mediated inhibition of Cdc25 but not mutational inactivation of Cdc25. Alternatively, suppression of GST&#x02013;Chk1 overproduction in <italic>&#x00394;mik1</italic> cells might involve checkpoint adaptation. This adaptation process would depend on intact Cdc25 protein that might be subject to positive regulation that counteracts the effect of Chk1. The notion of adaptation is consistent with the observation that <italic>&#x00394;mik1</italic> cells appear to temporarily cease division for a period after induction of GST&#x02013;Chk1 but eventually recover (our unpublished data). Checkpoint adaptation is unexplored in fission yeast but has been proposed to operate in budding yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">Toczyski <italic>et al.</italic>, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">Lee <italic>et al.</italic>, 1998</xref>),</p><p>The hypothesis that Mik1 is important for the DNA damage checkpoint was confirmed in studies that examined the effect of <italic>&#x00394;mik1</italic> in the checkpoint response elicited by continuous exposure to bleomycin. In wild-type cells, bleomycin causes a prolonged arrest that lasts for at least 240 min. In contrast, <italic>&#x00394;mik1</italic> cells exposed to bleomycin initially arrest normally but undergo division &#x0223c;100 min after the mock-treated cells. The fact that <italic>&#x00394;mik1</italic> cells undergo a substantial but abbreviated mitotic delay may explain why this defect has remain undiscovered until now.</p></sec><sec><title>Regulation of Mik1 by the DNA Damage Checkpoint</title><p>Having established that Mik1 is important for the DNA damage checkpoint, we then investigated how Mik1 might be regulated by the checkpoint apparatus. We found that Mik1 protein abundance was substantially increased in cells treated with bleomycin. This fact was evident from both immunoblot and immunolocalization studies. The latter studies indicated that Mik1 accumulation requires Rad3 and Chk1; therefore, the Mik1 accumulation appears be a consequence of DNA damage checkpoint activation. Indeed, G<sub>2</sub> arrest caused by the <italic>cdc25-22</italic> mutation did not lead to Mik1 accumulation, a result that indicates that Mik1 accumulation is a cause rather than a consequence of G<sub>2</sub> arrest induced by the DNA damage checkpoint. Mik1 is a dose-dependent inhibitor of mitosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">Lundgren <italic>et al.</italic>, 1991</xref>); thus, it is easy to understand how increased abundance of Mik1 would help to enforce the DNA damage checkpoint.</p><p>Mik1 abundance increases in cells arrested at the DNA damage checkpoint with bleomycin, but the magnitude of Mik1 accumulation is less than that observed in cells treated with hydroxyurea. The bleomycin effect is mediated through the damage checkpoint involving Chk1, whereas hydroxyurea leads to Cds1 activation as part of the replication checkpoint response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">Boddy <italic>et al.</italic>, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">Lindsay <italic>et al.</italic>, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">Brondello <italic>et al.</italic>, 1999</xref>). The difference in the magnitude of Mik1 protein accumulation is probably attributable, at least in part, to the difference in <italic>mik1</italic> mRNA accumulation. As we have shown here, there is substantially more <italic>mik1</italic> mRNA in cells arrested with hydroxyurea compared with bleomycin. The effect of hydroxyurea on <italic>mik1</italic> mRNA appears to be part of the S&#x02013;M replication checkpoint response, because it depends on Rad3.</p><p>We have presented initial studies aimed at determining the mechanism by which DNA damage induces the accumulation of Mik1 protein. We found that Mik1 accumulated in a <italic>mts3-1</italic> mutant that is defective in a subunit of the 26S proteasome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">Gordon <italic>et al.</italic>, 1996</xref>). Moreover, our studies revealed that Mik1 is ubiquitinated. These findings, and the fact that Mik1 abundance oscillates in a very transitory manner during the normal cell cycle, suggest that Mik1 protein is normally very unstable. These findings prompt speculation that the DNA damage checkpoint stabilizes Mik1 protein. There is precedence for checkpoint-induced stabilization of proteins in the Wee1/Mik1 family. In the budding yeast <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>, the Wee1/Mik1 homologue Swe1 is stabilized in cells arrested at the morphogenesis checkpoint that coordinates mitosis with bud formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">Sia <italic>et al.</italic>, 1998</xref>). In cell extracts, exogenous Swe1 is polyubiquitinated by a process that is impaired by <italic>cdc34</italic> or <italic>met30</italic> mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">Kaiser <italic>et al.</italic>, 1998</xref>). Cdc34 is an E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme, whereas Met30 is an &#x0201c;F box&#x0201d; protein that is a component of an E3 ubiquitin ligase enzyme. Swe1 protein is also stabilized by <italic>cdc34</italic> or <italic>met30</italic> mutations in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">Kaiser <italic>et al.</italic>, 1998</xref>). In <italic>Xenopus</italic> oocyte extracts, activation of the replication checkpoint stabilizes exogenous Wee1 protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">Michael and Newport, 1998</xref>). In these assays, Wee1 was stabilized by the addition of a dominant negative form of Cdc34. Together, these studies and our results suggest that the induced stabilization of Cdc2-directed tyrosine kinases plays an important role in checkpoint mechanisms that couple the onset of mitosis to DNA replication, DNA repair, or morphogenetic events required for successful cell division.</p></sec><sec><title>Regulation of Mik1 during S Phase</title><p>We have also explored Mik1 regulation during the normal cell cycle. Studies performed with synchronous cultures showed that <italic>mik1</italic><sup>&#x0002b;</sup> mRNA is expressed periodically during the cell cycle, with peak signals detected during S phase. The appearance of Mik1 protein was quite similar, being slightly delayed relative to the detection of <italic>mik1</italic><sup>&#x0002b;</sup> mRNA. These findings were confirmed by immunolocalization studies that showed that Mik1 is detected in binucleate cells and short uninucleate cells, a pattern that corresponds to S phase and perhaps early G<sub>2</sub>.</p><p>It is remarkable that expression of Mik1, a mitotic inhibitor, is enhanced during S phase. It is tempting to speculate that this pattern of Mik1 expression helps to couple the onset of mitosis to the completion of DNA replication in cell cycles that are unperturbed by DNA replication or damage checkpoints. This could be an intrinsic mechanism of inhibiting mitosis during S phase. DNA replication is normally completed very quickly after nuclear division in fission yeast, long before cells have satisfied the size requirement for the initiation of mitosis. Thus, in these conditions, the Mik1-independent cell size control is sufficient to ensure that mitosis occurs after the completion of DNA replication. This cell size control requires Wee1, as indicated by the phenotype of <italic>wee1</italic><sup>&#x02212;</sup> mutants, which undergo mitosis at approximately half the size of wild-type cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">Nurse, 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">Russell and Nurse, 1987b</xref>). In fact, simultaneous inactivation of Wee1 and Mik1 causes a mitotic catastrophe in which cells undergo mitosis at a very small size and apparently before the completion of DNA replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">Lundgren <italic>et al.</italic>, 1991</xref>). Thus, in a <italic>wee1</italic><sup>&#x02212;</sup> mutant, the periodic expression of Mik1 that occurs during S phase is essential to couple the onset of mitosis to the completion of DNA replication.</p><p>It remains to be determined if there are situations that do not involve the inhibition of DNA replication in which periodic expression of Mik1 during S phase is required to couple mitosis to the completion of DNA replication. In some conditions of poor nutrient availability, wild-type cells divide at a small cell size that approaches the size of <italic>wee1</italic><sup>&#x02212;</sup> mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">Fantes and Nurse, 1977</xref>). It is possible that Wee1 is inactivated in poor nutrient conditions, thereby accounting for the contraction of G<sub>2</sub> and the extension of G<sub>1</sub>. Future experiments will determine if Mik1 is important for proper mitotic control in these circumstances.</p></sec><sec><title>Strategies for Dual Enforcement of Checkpoints</title><p>This and previous studies provide strong evidence that replication and damage checkpoint arrests are maintained through two general mechanisms: negative regulation of Cdc25 and positive regulation of Mik1 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9</xref>). In each case, the effect is the same, namely, to maintain tyrosine 15 phosphorylation of Cdc2 and thereby prevent the onset of mitosis. The question arises regarding the relative importance of the two modes of regulation. The <italic>&#x00394;mik1</italic> mutation clearly causes a damage checkpoint defect, but this defect is modest relative to the absence of checkpoint arrest seen in <italic>&#x00394;chk1</italic> cells. Likewise, the hydroxyurea-induced replication checkpoint fails gradually in a population of <italic>&#x00394;mik1</italic> cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">Zeng <italic>et al.</italic>, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">Furnari <italic>et al.</italic>, 1999</xref>), whereas the checkpoint is abolished in <italic>&#x00394;rad3</italic> or <italic>&#x00394;cds1 &#x00394;chk1</italic> cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">Boddy <italic>et al.</italic>, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">Lindsay <italic>et al.</italic>, 1998</xref>). This comparison suggests that positive regulation of Mik1 may be of secondary import relative to negative regulation of Cdc25. However, this view of the checkpoint mechanism may be incorrect, because the equivalent experiment cannot be performed with a strain that lacks Cdc25 but is otherwise wild type. The closest approximation are studies with <italic>&#x00394;cdc25 cdc2-3w</italic> cells, which have shown that the damage checkpoint is largely but not completely eliminated. However, in these studies, the effect of the <italic>cdc2-3w</italic> mutation cannot be ascertained with certainty. Attempts to specifically abrogate the checkpoint regulation of Cdc25 by mutation of Cds1- or Chk1-directed phosphorylation sites have produced only partial checkpoint defects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">Zeng <italic>et al.</italic>, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">Furnari <italic>et al.</italic>, 1999</xref>), although only a subset of phosphorylation sites have been eliminated in these experiments. Therefore, an accurate evaluation of the relative importance of Cdc25 and Mik1 regulation in the checkpoint responses awaits a more detailed understanding of the modes of regulation. These questions will be more fully addressed with the invention of a method to specifically abrogate checkpoint regulation of Cdc25.  </p><p>An alternative viewpoint is that Mik1 has specialized importance in maintaining long-term checkpoint arrests. In our studies with bleomycin treatment, we observed that the <italic>&#x00394;mik1</italic> mutation caused a dramatic failure of the checkpoint arrest, but this failure occurred &#x0223c;100 min after mock-treated cells underwent mitosis. Two factors may be important in these circumstances. One factor is checkpoint adaptation. Some types of DNA damage may be unrepairable but not necessarily lethal to both daughter cells. In this case, the best survival strategy is to relieve the checkpoint arrest and undergo division. This postulated mechanism of active checkpoint override has been termed &#x0201c;adaptation&#x0201d; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">Toczyski <italic>et al.</italic>, 1997</xref>). The behavior of <italic>&#x00394;mik1</italic> cells in bleomycin might be viewed as premature adaptation.</p><p>Size control of mitosis is a second factor that may explain the significance of Mik1 regulation by the DNA damage checkpoint. Cells must reach a certain size threshold before initiating mitosis, but after this threshold is reached, it is likely that mitosis-promoting &#x0201c;forces&#x0201d; increase as cell growth continues. These forces might be influenced by the continued accumulation of Cdc25 or cyclin B (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">Booher and Beach, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">Moreno <italic>et al.</italic>, 1990</xref>) or the increased activity of the kinases Nim1/Cdr1 or Cdr2 that inhibit Wee1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">Russell and Nurse, 1987a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">Coleman <italic>et al.</italic>, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">Parker <italic>et al.</italic>, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">Wu and Russell, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">Breeding <italic>et al.</italic>, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">Kanoh and Russell, 1998</xref>), to name only some possibilities. Hence, Chk1-mediated inhibition of Cdc25 may be sufficient to delay mitosis in cells that are somewhat above the size threshold, but reliance on this regulation alone may fail as cell size increases further. Thus, regulation of Mik1 by the DNA damage checkpoint may be particularly important in late G<sub>2</sub> cells that suffer a large amount of DNA damage or damage that requires more time to repair.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="display-objects"><title>Figures and Tables</title><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Chk1-dependent mitotic delay caused by ionizing irradiation in <italic>cdc2-3w &#x00394;cdc25</italic> cells.
