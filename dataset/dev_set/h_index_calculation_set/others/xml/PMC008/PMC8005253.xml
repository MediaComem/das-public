As of March 28, 2021, data from the World Health Organization (WHO) showed that the number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 has increased to 126, 372, 442, and the number of deaths has risen to 2, 769, 696 (<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">World&#x000a0;Health Organization,&#x000a0;2021</xref>). On January 20, 2020, China incorporated COVID-19 into the group of class B infectious diseases and managed it according to class A procedures (<xref rid="bib0011" ref-type="bibr">National&#x000a0;Health Commission of the People&#x02019;s Republic of China,&#x000a0;2020</xref>). On March 11, 2020, the WHO declared COVID-19 epidemic a public health emergency of international concern (<xref rid="bib0017" ref-type="bibr">WHO,&#x000a0;2020</xref>). Medical institutions, especially hospitals, were to increase their preparedness for a surge of patients with COVID-19 who would require hospitalization. The work hours per shift among nurses, who serve as important members of medical and health institutions play a key role in the response effects of the epidemic and in nurses' physical and mental health (<xref rid="bib0009" ref-type="bibr">Lam&#x000a0;et&#x000a0;al., 2018</xref>). Previous evidence has suggested that work hours for nurses could affect quality of care (<xref rid="bib0007" ref-type="bibr">Griffiths&#x000a0;et&#x000a0;al., 2014</xref>). The National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China (National Health Commission of the PRC) recommended 4 h per shift for intensive care unit nurses in the hospitals providing treatment to patients with COVID-19 (<xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">Nutional&#x000a0;Health Commission of the People&#x02019;s Republic of China,&#x000a0;2020</xref>).

However, given that many units and different posts were involved in the treatment of patients with COVID-19, the nurses reported preferred work hours per shift of different units and posts are still unknown. Therefore, the aim of this study is to investigate and analyse the actual work hours and the nurses reported preferred work hours per shift for different units and posts among frontline nurses in China. In addition, we will explore the factors influencing the nurses reported preferred work hours through summary content analysis.</p></sec><sec id="sec0002"><label>2</label><title>Methods</title><sec id="sec0003"><label>2.1</label><title>Study design and participants</title><p id="para0010">This study was a cross-sectional survey.

The authors and researchers were deployed to these designated hospitals during the period of the study and were recruited participants in their respective areas. Approximately 10~100 potential participants in each designated hospital were known to the authors and researchers and finally a total of 109 nurses agreed to participate in this study.This facilitated the recruitment of participants in the respective areas of the designated hospitals and ensured that the sample was representative of all individuals working in this setting.

The potentially overwhelming burden of illnesses that stressed the capacity of health systems and caused adverse effects, such as the risk of infection among health care workers has increased, affecting both nurses and the quality of healthcare that nurses provide. Numerous studies have focused on the effects of extended and shorten work hours on patients, nurses and organizations. Results from Lam et&#x000a0;al. showed that human resource limitation is one of the main factors hindering emergency nurses' response to emerging infectious disease epidemic behaviour (<xref rid="bib0010" ref-type="bibr">Lam&#x000a0;et&#x000a0;al., 2019</xref>). Kunaviktikul et&#x000a0;al. reported that the prolonged work hours of nurses can contribute to a series of adverse effects on nurses themselves, patients and the health system (<xref rid="bib0008" ref-type="bibr">Kunaviktikul&#x000a0;et&#x000a0;al., 2015</xref>). Bae et&#x000a0;al. concluded that when the shift length was 12 h, patients' adverse outcomes (i.e., hypoglycaemia events or errors, proximity errors, and pneumonia death), adverse events reports, and dissatisfaction increased (<xref rid="bib0001" ref-type="bibr">Bae&#x000a0;and Fabry,&#x000a0;2014</xref>). Patterson et&#x000a0;al. pointed out that shorter shift durations were more beneficial to mitigate fatigue and fatigue-related risks than longer shift durations (<xref rid="bib0013" ref-type="bibr">Patterson&#x000a0;et&#x000a0;al,&#x000a0;2018</xref>). How to manage frontline nurses' work hours scientifically and how to ensure their physical and mental safety while improving their response readiness are urgent problems for health managers to address.</p><p id="para0043">The results of this study showed that the actual work hours of the frontline nurses were longer than the nurses&#x02019; reported preferred work hours [Median (IQR): 5.00 (2.00) h vs 4.00 (2.00) h; Min-Max: 4 - 12 h vs 4 - 8 h]. In addition, 60.55% (66/109) of nurses considered 4 h to be the preferred length of work per shift (<xref rid="tbl0002" ref-type="table">Table&#x000a0;2</xref>), which was consistent with the recommendation of 4 h by the National Health Commission of the PRC on February 29,2020 (<xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">Nutional&#x000a0;Health Commission of the People&#x02019;s Republic of China,&#x000a0;2020</xref>). In terms of the different units of analysis, the actual work hours of intensive care unit nurses were the same as the nurses reported preferred work hours, and the actual work hours of the remaining units were longer than the nurses reported preferred work hours. This may be related to the fact that patients in the intensive care unit were in such serious condition that managers tended to allocate more nurses to this area. In contrast, the actual work hours of the direct nursing posts were the same as the nurses reported preferred work hours of nurses in different posts, the actual work hours of other posts were longer than the preferred work hours. However, our results also suggested that the work hours of direct nursing posts were fewer than those of indirect nursing posts (<xref rid="tbl0003" ref-type="table">Table&#x000a0;3</xref>). This may be explained by nurse managers requiring nurses of indirect nursing posts to not wear personal protective equipment and work for longer hours to conserve protective equipment and human resources, because nurses without personal protective equipment can go to toilet or eat food timely. <xref rid="bib0014" ref-type="bibr">Peng&#x000a0;et&#x000a0;al.&#x000a0;(2020)</xref> reported that they had set the nurses&#x02019; work hours per shift to 12 h, 4h, and 2&#x02013;3 h according to the workload and posts. <xref rid="bib0006" ref-type="bibr">Gagliano&#x000a0;et&#x000a0;al.&#x000a0;(2020)</xref> also concluded that sub-district post management was beneficial to conserve manpower and protective equipment resources.</p><p id="para0044">We also performed a summary content analysis of the nurses&#x02019; reasons for the nurses reported preferred work hours. Five themes appeared which included circumstances; personal protective equipment; the nurses&#x02019; physical and psychological needs; and the nurses&#x02019; safety needs and work intensity. Circumstances indicate that different units and posts have different requirements. Nurse 107: &#x0201c;It is ideal to set work hours according to different circumstances (units and posts)&#x0201d;. The main problems of the personal protective equipment were that nurses had to spend large amount of time wearing it, and fog drops appeared on the goggles which could block nurses&#x02019; line of sight. Moreover, pain, dehydration, sweating and other symptoms of discomfort occurred during the use of personal protective equipment. As far as the physiological and psychological needs of nurses are concerned, they mainly included respiratory needs, getting adequate rest, eating food and going to the toilet, because nurses are prone to hypoxia, dyspnoea, headache, fatigue, hunger and stress during work. For nurses&#x02019; safety needs, work hours can affect the risk of infection, e g, according to -Nurse 95: &#x0201c;4 h was preferred which can reduce the risk of infection and preserve physical strength&#x0201d;. Finally, work intensity encompassed the efficiency work and overwork, e g, as stated by- Nurse 39: &#x0201c;There was so much work (i.e., prepare oxygen cylinder, provide care to patient, observe of the condition of the patients) that needed to be done&#x0201d;. The results from an earlier study reported that COVID-19 was spread by human-to-human transmission via droplets or direct contact (<xref rid="bib0015" ref-type="bibr">Rothan&#x000a0;and Byrareddy,&#x000a0;2020</xref>), and personal protective equipment is a necessary for medical staff to protect themselves from being infected. However, the use of personal protective equipment has resulted in many problems. Zhou et&#x000a0;al reported that personal protective equipment could lead to sensory deprivation and a psychological stress response (<xref rid="bib0024" ref-type="bibr">Zhou&#x000a0;et&#x000a0;al., 2020</xref>). A survey of frontline doctors and nurses in West Africa by Den Boon et&#x000a0;al found that the use of personal protective equipment resulted in sweating and dehydration among medical staff, and the prolonged use of goggles led to fog that their obscured vision, thus affecting their clinical practice (<xref rid="bib0004" ref-type="bibr">Den&#x000a0;Boon et&#x000a0;al., 2018</xref>). Xia et&#x000a0;al reported that in the course of using personal protective equipment, pain, numbness, pressure, redness, or even damaged equipment related to the pressure damage are prone to occur (<xref rid="bib0020" ref-type="bibr">Xia&#x000a0;et&#x000a0;al., 2020</xref>). Zou et&#x000a0;al conducted a semi-structured interview with 7 frontline nursing staff caring for COVID-19 patients and concluded that the frontline nursing staff had a heavy workload (<xref rid="bib0022" ref-type="bibr">Yao&#x000a0;et&#x000a0;al., 2020</xref>). All of these results were similar to the findings in our study.</p><p id="para0045">The major strengths of this study were as follows. First, we analyzed the actual work hours and the nurses reported preferred work hours of frontline nurses in different units and posts. Second, the results of this study showed the gap between actual work hours and nurses reported preferred work hours for frontline nurses fighting the COVID-19 pandemic. Third, we used content analysis to explore the factors influencing preferred work hours, this method can provide important information to nurse managers.</p><p id="para0046">The main limitations in this study were that the nurses preferred work hours per shift were obtained via nurse self-assessment, which may lack objectivity and reliability. Moreover, the time of implementation of this study was from February 24 to March 12, 2020, when nursing human resources and personal protective equipment had basically met clinical needs in China. Therefore, the results of this study may not be generalizable to medical institutions that have major shortages of nursing personnel and personal protective equipment.</p></sec><sec id="sec0020"><label>5</label><title>Conclusions</title><p id="para0047">This study suggests that there is a gap between the actual work hours and the nurses reported preferred work hours among nurses of different units and posts who provided care to patients with COVID-19. The main influencing factors come from five aspects, namely circumstances, personal protective equipment, the nurses&#x02019; physical and emotional needs, the nurses&#x02019; safety needs and work intensity.</p></sec><sec id="sec0021"><title>What is already known about the topic?</title><p id="para9001">
