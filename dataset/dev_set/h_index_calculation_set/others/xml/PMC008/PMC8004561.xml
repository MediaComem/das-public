Levothyroxine (LT4) is standard therapy for hypothyroidism and different types of LT4 formulations are available: tablets, soft-gel capsules, and liquid solutions. Soft-gel capsules and liquid solution are relatively new LT4 formulations and were manufactured to overcome some of the bioavailability issues in tablets. The bioavailability may be reduced when tablets are administered simultaneously with food and beverages, other types of medication (e.g., proton-pump inhibitors, phosphate binders, calcium carbonate, and iron supplements), or concurrent gastrointestinal conditions (e.g., <italic>Helicobacter pylori</italic> infection, coeliac disease, bariatric surgery, and atrophic gastritis) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>].</p><p id="Par6">While all available LT4 formulations are regarded as effective in treating hypothyroidism, pre-existing morbidity is increased in hypothyroid individuals, and post-diagnosis co-morbidity from both somatic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>] and psychiatric [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>] disorders is higher than in euthyroid controls. This eventually is accompanied by a higher rate of disability pension, loss of labor market income [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>], and excess mortality from natural as well as unnatural causes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. The aforementioned, together with the fact that quality of life is reported as still impaired, and may not be fully restored despite treatment with LT4 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>], is one among many factors leading to the pursuit of better treatment options for hypothyroid individuals. The evidence suggests differences in bioavailability in favor of liquid solution and soft-gel capsules compared to tablets both in patients with and without impaired absorption [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Soft-gel capsules and liquid solution are more expensive than tablets, and the cost-effectiveness of switching from tablets to these new formulations remains unsettled [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>].</p><p id="Par7">Before LT4 was synthesized, desiccated thyroid extract&#x000a0;(DTE) was standard therapy. DTE is derived from the thyroid glands of animals and contains both T4 and T3. Combination therapy can also consist of the synthetic preparation of T3, liothyronine (LT3), and LT4. Thyroid guidelines uniformly favor LT4 as standard therapy, while attitudes diverge regarding combination therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Some patients suffering from thyroid failure have persistent symptoms despite adequate thyroid hormone replacement therapy with LT4 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. According to current Danish and international guidelines, combination therapy with LT3 and LT4 may be considered in such individuals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].</p><p id="Par8">LT4 prescriptions are increasing in Denmark [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. The reasons for this include iodine fortification in food, leading to a higher incidence of thyroid autoimmunity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>], a decreasing TSH threshold for initiating treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>], and increasing diagnostic activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Likewise, combination therapy with LT4&#x02009;+&#x02009;LT3 or DTE is also gaining popularity in Denmark [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>], mostly due to growing demands from patients dissatisfied with the LT4 treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. However, prescribing T3-containing preparations is not without potential risks. Side effects due to possible iatrogenic hyperthyroidism are a concern, and the extensive evidence for non-superiority of combination therapy over LT4 does not support this trend [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].</p><p id="Par9">This Danish survey was part of an ongoing international incentive referred to as THESIS (<italic>T</italic>reatment of <italic>H</italic>ypothyroidism in <italic>E</italic>urope by <italic>S</italic>pecialists: An <italic>I</italic>nternational <italic>S</italic>urvey).

An open-access survey platform, Lime-Survey, was used to build and distribute the questionnaire, and a written introduction preceded the survey.

Both tablets and soft-gel capsules are commercially available in Denmark. However, only one in five DES members would consider prescribing soft-gel capsules to patients for whom it is inconvenient to separate LT4 and food intake. In such a situation, some patients might benefit from switching to soft-gel capsules, although the evidence is weak [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Danish endocrinologists are also reluctant to use soft-gel capsules in other situations, e.g., interfering drug intake, gastrointestinal disease, poor biochemical control on tablets, or persistent symptoms despite biochemical control. The reason for this attitude is unknown, but probably more data on cost-effectiveness is needed to allow evidence-based use of these new LT4-formulations, as reviewed by Nagy et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Interestingly, respondents with a membership of ETA and/or ATA are more prone to prescribe liquid solutions or soft-gel capsules, as compared to colleagues without such international affiliations.</p><p id="Par29">In the Italian THESIS investigation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>], 75% recommended soft-gel capsules or liquid solution to patients established on LT4 but having poor biochemical control of their hypothyroidism. Interestingly, only 14.5% of the Danish endocrinologists agree with this strategy. Liquid thyroid hormone solutions are not available in Denmark, while soft-gel capsules have been on the Italian market for a longer time than in Denmark. Thus, Italian endocrinologists are probably more familiar with other formulations of LT4 than tablets. Other factors explaining why soft-gel capsules are more frequently prescribed in Italy than in Denmark could be differences in cost and marketing and the fact that most studies of efficacy, safety and bioavailability of soft-gel capsules have been conducted in Italy. Another hindrance for the more widespread use of soft-gel capsules in Denmark is the requirement for the Danish Medicines Agency to verify the indication for this formulation to allow reimbursement of expenses. Finally, the lack of evidence for or against the cost-effectiveness of soft-gel capsules compared to tablets may promote diverse practices.</p></sec><sec id="Sec16"><title>Thyroid hormone therapy in euthyroid patients</title><p id="Par30">In accordance with current guidelines, most respondents agree that thyroid hormone substitution is never indicated in treatment-na&#x000ef;ve euthyroid patients. Two out of five Danish endocrinologists would consider thyroid hormone supplementation for infertile women with high levels of thyroid autoantibodies. According to current Danish guidelines, treatment with LT4 might be considered in some euthyroid anti-TPO positive women undergoing fertility treatment, in whom plasma TSH is within the upper normal reference range (i.e., 2.5&#x02013;4.0 mIU/L). The rationale being to secure euthyroidism in case of pregnancy, although LT4 treatment neither promotes conception nor reduces the risk of pregnancy complications in such individuals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>].</p><p id="Par31">Only one in ten DES members suggests treating a growing goiter with LT4. A previous questionnaire study demonstrated that the preferred treatment for nontoxic goiter in Denmark is radioiodine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>].

In line with the ambiguous evidence regarding such supplementation, the Danish endocrinologists are divided, stating that either dietary supplements should never be used or that they could be used at the request of the patients.</p><p id="Par37">Mandatory iodine fortification of salt was implemented in Denmark in 2000 because of mild to moderate iodine deficiency.

We excluded physicians with other specialties than endocrinology to focus on those who manage thyroid patients regularly. In Denmark, a large proportion of endocrinologists manage only patients with diabetes. By circulating the questionnaire to all Danish Endocrine Society members, we obtained 152 responses (31.2% response rate), but also targeted many who do not see such patients. Most DES members who are clinically active within the thyroid field are organized within the Danish Thyroid Association, comprising 115 members. The fact that the number of respondents was considerably higher (i.e. 152) indicates that most endocrinologists, being de facto eligible for this survey, were included. Thus, the response rate may be well above 31.2%, taking the relevant target group into account.</p><p id="Par41">Limitations include the virtual patient cases with loss of nuances potentially interfering with the interpretation. The fact that less than a third of eligible clinicians completed the survey questions the generalizability of conclusions to that of all Danish endocrinologists. Our questionnaire was distributed at the beginning of the Covid-19 pandemic, which might have impacted response rates negatively.</p><p id="Par42">In conclusion, in Denmark the treatment of choice for hypothyroidism is LT4 tablets, also when conditions affecting bioavailability are present. Combination therapy with LT4&#x02009;+&#x02009;LT3 is considered for patients treated with LT4 with persistent symptoms and stable TSH within the reference range, while only a few DES members prescribe&#x000a0;DTE. Notably, the outcome in questions regarding treatment and monitoring does not generally depend on the demographic variables of the respondents, with the exception of the use of soft-gel capsules. LT4 treatment of infertile euthyroid women harboring thyroid antibodies and a wish for pregnancy is still considered by a substantial fraction of Danish endocrinologists. The attitude toward selenium&#x000a0;and iodine supplementation in patients with hypothyroidism remains largely controversial.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Information</title><sec id="Sec21"><p>Below is the link to the electronic supplementary material.<supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="MOESM1"><media xlink:href="40618_2021_1555_MOESM1_ESM.pdf"><caption><p>Supplementary file1 (PDF 159 KB)</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></p></sec></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p>THESIS: <italic>T</italic>reatment of <italic>H</italic>ypothyroidism in <italic>E</italic>urope by <italic>S</italic>pecialists: An <italic>I</italic>nternational <italic>S</italic>urvey.</p></fn><fn><p><bold>Publisher's Note</bold></p><p>Springer Nature remains neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.</p></fn></fn-group><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank all members of the Danish Endocrine Society, who contributed to the study by answering the questionnaire.</p></ack><notes notes-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><p>EVN, EP, PP, RN, RA, and LH contributed to the study conception, design and&#x000a0;creation of the questionnaire.
