MRR indicated elevated COVID-19 morality rates among Asian/Pacific Islander, Black, and Hispanic groups compared with the White group, with Black and Hispanic groups having the highest MRR at 2.75 (95%CI: 2.54&#x02013;2.97) and 4.18 (95%CI: 3.99&#x02013;4.37), respectively. Disparities were larger at younger ages. Similar results were observed with PMR, and patterns of age-racial/ethnic disparities remained in analyses stratified by education. Elevated PMR were observed in all ethnicity/nativity groups, especially foreign-born Hispanic individuals, relative to U.S.-born non-Hispanic individuals.

Identifying COVID-19 disparities is an initial step toward mitigating disease impacts in vulnerable communities. Much of the current evidence, however, has relied on ecologic analyses using aggregate data for both the characteristic under study (e.g., percentage Black in a county) and COVID-19 outcome (e.g., county-level mortality) [<xref rid="bib0001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="bib0003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="bib0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="bib0013" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, <xref rid="bib0014" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, <xref rid="bib0015" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>]. Studies that have been conducted with individual-level data are primarily derived from hospital/healthcare networks or insurance companies [<xref rid="bib0002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="bib0004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="bib0006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="bib0007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="bib0009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="bib0016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], which may not be representative of COVID-19 impacts in the general population given barriers to healthcare access and insurance among historically marginalized groups. Use of death certificate data allows for investigation into individual-level characteristics, captures all individuals in the catchment area, and does not suffer from substantial under-reporting of key characteristics as was seen for race/ethnicity information for COVID-19 decedents early in the pandemic. It is important to note that any disparities observed for COVID-19 morality are an accumulation of disproportionate impacts along the entire continuum of COVID-19 disease, beginning with exposure to the virus and culminating in death. The mechanisms and magnitudes of disparities likely differ for each step of the disease pathway <xref rid="bib0017" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. Appropriate estimates of disease are needed, not only by single factors, such as racial/ethnic group, but also by intersections with other factors, such as with age, sex, and educational attainment, which considers that groups are not homogenous and indeed reflect diverse experiences and impacts of the pandemic <xref rid="bib0018" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, <xref rid="bib0019" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, <xref rid="bib0020" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>.

In addition to descriptive information on decedents, COVID-19 mortality was compared across racial/ethnic groups considering age, sex, and education using mortality rate ratios (MRR) and proportionate mortality ratios (PMR).

Data for 2020 were updated weekly and last date of data export used in this analysis was September 9, 2020. Race/ethnicity were grouped into non-Hispanic White, non-Hispanic Black, Asian/Pacific Islander (regardless of Hispanicity; Asian/PI), American Indian/Alaskan Native (regardless of Hispanicity; AI/AN), Hispanic (excludes A/PI, AI/AN), and Multiracial/Other/Unknown. County of birth was used to define decedents&#x02019; nativity status, categorized as U.S.-born or foreign-born. Categories of ethnicity and nativity combined were U.S.-born non-Hispanic, U.S.-born Hispanic, Foreign-born non-Hispanic, and Foreign-born Hispanic, using Hispanicity as defined for race/ethnicity.

Effective April 1, 2020, there was a new ICD-10 code for COVID-19, U07.1; however, because we used the dynamic CCDF file with weekly updates for recent mortality, final coded data on underlying cause of death and relevant conditions were not available for all 2020 deaths. Thus, we developed an algorithm using the code U07.1 and a keyword search to identify COVID-19-related deaths and applied it to all deaths occurring after February 1, 2020 (e<xref rid="fig0001" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#x000a0;1</xref>

PM was defined as number of COVID-19 deaths in a specified subpopulation (e.g., a certain racial/ethnic group) divided by average all-cause mortality in the same subpopulation occurring March 1-July 31 in 2016&#x02013;2019 among decedents aged 20 years and older (multiplied by 100 to be akin to a percentage). The PM metric allows for COVID-19 mortality to be interpreted as a percentage of &#x0201c;typical&#x0201d; mortality in a group. Mortality for past years was restricted to match the time frame for 2020 COVID-19 deaths to account for annual trends in mortality. All-cause mortality in 2020 was not used as the reference, which would have been common for PM.

PM ratios (PMR) were used to compare across decedent characteristics, including racial/ethnic group, sex, educational attainment, and ethnicity and nativity combined, as well as combinations of these.

Disproportionate COVID-19 mortality was observed among Black, Hispanic, and Asian/PI groups in CA. Larger relative disparities were observed at younger ages for Black and Hispanic individuals. Disparities persisted after accounting for educational attainment, serving here as a proxy for socioeconomic status. Disproportionate mortality was also observed by combinations of ethnicity and nativity, with all groups (especially foreign-born Hispanic individuals) having greater COVID-19 mortality compared with U.S.-born non-Hispanic individuals, particularly at younger ages. Disparities by nativity remained in analyses controlling for educational attainment. The larger disparities in younger age groups are particularly important given younger populations may be overlooked in public health campaigns due to their overall lower risk of severe disease. Here, however, we observed the mortality rate for Black individuals aged 55&#x02013;64 to be higher than mortality rate for White individuals 10 years older, and the mortality rate for Hispanic individuals aged 55&#x02013;64 years to be approaching mortality rate for White individuals 20 years older. The much larger disparities observed in MRR for Hispanic individuals compared with Black individuals, for all ages but particularly for younger ages, are likely driven in part by the high COVID-19 mortality observed for foreign-born Hispanic individuals. Younger populations should be included among targets in public health interventions. Disparities in COVID-19 mortality may be driven by a variety of factors, including complex interaction between social and structural determinates of health, barriers to accessing care, higher prevalence of underlying co-morbidities associated with more severe COVID-19 disease and adverse outcomes, and differential exposure to virus due to working and living conditions [<xref rid="bib0024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="bib0029" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>, <xref rid="bib0030" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>, <xref rid="bib0031" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>, <xref rid="bib0032" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>, <xref rid="bib0033" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>, <xref rid="bib0034" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>]&#x02014;which maybe different and interact differently among the different groups (race/ethnicity and ethnicity/nativity) and subgroups (age-race/ethnicity and age-ethnicity/nativity groups) examined here.</p><p id="para0021">Differences in COVID-19 mortality can develop anywhere along the disease continuum from exposure, to incidence, severity, and then ultimately death.

Factors that may contribute to mortality disparities and could be targets for interventions include barriers to healthcare access including medical mistrust and insurance, living and working conditions, being essential/frontline workers, underlying health conditions including suboptimal disease management, and social and structural determinants of health [<xref rid="bib0024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="bib0029" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>, <xref rid="bib0030" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>, <xref rid="bib0031" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>, <xref rid="bib0032" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>, <xref rid="bib0033" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>,<xref rid="bib0039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Interactions between structural, social, and individual factors that contribute to differential COVID-19 mortality are complex and vary not only across these different historically marginalized groups (e.g., Black, Hispanic, Asian/PI, foreign-born Hispanic), but also within these groups (e.g., younger and older Hispanic individuals). Public health interventions and policies should consider the differing and complex risk structure across and within these groups. For example, differential workplace exposure may contribute to increased mortality among younger Black and Hispanic, including foreign-born Hispanic, individuals. People of color are more likely to be employed in essential industries and in occupations with more exposure to infections and close proximity to others <xref rid="bib0030" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>. Black workers in particular face an elevated risk for these factors <xref rid="bib0030" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>. A study of workplace COVID-19 outbreaks in Utah found 73% of cases were in Hispanic or non-White workers, whereas Hispanic and non-White workers represent only 24% of the workforce in affected industries <xref rid="bib0033" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>. Immigrant families faced additional complicating factors (e.g., employment in jobs with higher potential exposure, no/inadequate health insurance and paid leave, multigenerational housing, etc. [<xref rid="bib0040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>,<xref rid="bib0041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]) which must be considered for public health planning. For example public charge regulations may have disincentivized immigrant families from accessing healthcare if they become symptomatic [<xref rid="bib0040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>,<xref rid="bib0041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. This delays testing and treatment and may increase disease transmission risk within their home and communities [<xref rid="bib0040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>,<xref rid="bib0041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>].</p><p id="para0024">This study has limitations. First, while use of death certificate data has many advantages, there were a limited number of available demographic and socioeconomic variables. Augmentation of these data with neighborhood characteristics based on decedent residential address is an area of future work. Second, the variable related to socioeconomic position used in this analysis&#x02014;educational attainment&#x02014;is only one dimension of person's socioeconomic status and does not fully capture this complex determinant of health. Further, there may be misreporting of educational attainment on death certificates, with prior studies finding higher underreporting of educational attainment for Black and Hispanic decedents compared with White decedents <xref rid="bib0042" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>. This is also likely for foreign-born individuals. Any differential misreporting, however, would be expected to lead to less misclassification among Black and Hispanic (and possibly also foreign-born) decedents categorized as &#x0201c;Some college or more&#x0201d; yet large mortality disparities persisted in stratified analyses. Third, PM, and thus PMR, uses as a comparison all-cause mortality, which if different between groups may over or underestimate differences in mortality between groups. When all-cause mortality rates are lower compared with the referent group, PMR will overestimate differences in COVID-19 mortality, but as discussed differences in all-cause mortality rates were not sufficient to explain all observed COVID-19 disparities. When all-cause mortality rates are higher, such as was observed for Black individuals, the PMR will underestimate differences COVID-19 mortality. This study has several strengths. First, to identify COVID-19 mortality we used death certificate data which captures all mortality in the state and does not restrict to individuals in a healthcare/insurance network. Second, we had information on individual-level demographic characteristics on decedents, which was advantageous in two regards: (i) there was substantial under-reporting of race/ethnicity for COVID-19 decedents early in the pandemic and there is still a lack of reporting by nativity, which precludes analyses by these factors, and (ii) we did not have to rely on aggregate demographic data which could be subject to the ecologic fallacy. Third, because of this individual-level data we were able to examine mortality by several demographic factors in combination to better understand intersectional impacts of COVID-19.</p></sec><sec id="sec0010"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="para0025">Differential COVID-19 mortality was observed in California across racial/ethnic groups and by ethnicity and nativity combined, with evidence of greater disparities among younger age groups.
