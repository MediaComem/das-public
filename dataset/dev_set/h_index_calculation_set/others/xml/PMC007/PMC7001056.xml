Advanced CT plays a useful role for delineating anatomical structures, specifically the morphology the RA that helps in clinical and diagnosis decision. In this study, we determined the impact of age and gender on length and diameters of the RAs.</p><p>The current study revealed that there was a significant difference in length and diameters between left and right RAs. It was observed that the width of the right RA was significantly lesser than that of the left. Our results are in agreement with the findings reported by Saldarriaga et al<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> that the right RA diameter was significantly lesser than the left RA. A study performed by Tarzamni et al, who used a multi-slice CT scan reported that the diameter of right RA was smaller than the left RA (<italic>p</italic>=0.35).<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> It was noted that the mean length of the right RA in the current study was significantly longer than the mean length of the left RA (<italic>p</italic>&#x0003c;0.001) (<xref rid="T1" ref-type="table"><bold>Table 1</bold></xref>). In a previous study, it was reported that the mean length of the right RA was longer than the left RA (<italic>p</italic>=0.002).<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> This is attributed to the location of the abdominal aorta (AA) to the left median sagittal plane in the abdominal cavity and the long path of the RA on the right side, as reported by previous studies.<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></p><p>The present study revealed that gender differences significantly influenced the lengths and diameters of RAs. It was observed that the length of the right and left RAs were significantly longer in males than females (<italic>p</italic>=0.03 and <italic>p=</italic>0.02). The diameters of RAs were higher in males than females. The results of the study were consistent with previous studies<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> that show that the lengths and widths of RAs were smaller in males than males. The gender variation in renal measurements was attributed to the relatively large body habitus of males compared to females.<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></p><p>Aging is established to cause vascular compliance and increased vascular rigidity.<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> It was observed that mean diameters of both renal arteries was significantly reduced in advanced age groups (56-75 and 76-90 years old) (<italic>p</italic>&#x0003c;0.001), while it increased in the age groups between 36 and 55 years. Many authors studied the influence of age on diameters of RA. A study stated that a strong correlation was found between age and narrowing of renal RAs diameters.<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> The increase in diameter in adults is attributed to increased physical activity and consequently elevated cardiac output.<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> The reduction in luminal diameter of RA with advancing age is probably due to the progressive thickening of the internal intima layer increase in the collagen matrix in the renal arterial wall.<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></p><sec id="sec2-2"><title>Study limitation</title><p>Limitation of this study was the small sample size, and the authors could not follow-up all the abnormalities that affect the morphology of the RAs.

Widths and lengths both arteries were significantly different between males and females. Significant reduction of diameters of RAs was attributed to aging.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgment</title><p><italic>I would like to express my gratitude too all my colleague who helped me during the study period.
