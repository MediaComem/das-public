This leads to the activation of N-Methyl-D-Aspartate (NMDA) and &#x003b1;-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) receptors thereby modulating neuronal circuits and strengthening synaptic connectivity.<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> This strengthening of synaptic connections has been proven to modulate cerebellar functions by inducing plastic changes in the cerebellar structure.<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></p><p>McCreery et al<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> found that there was no neuronal harm to the brain below a current density of 25 mA/ cm<sup>2</sup>.

Moreover, damage to brain tissue occurs when the accumulative charge of current crosses a threshold of 216 C/cm<sup>2</sup>.<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> Because the maximum total charge attained with an intensity of 2 mA is 1.14 C/cm<sup>2</sup>, no neuronal harm is possible.</p><p>In terms of motor functions, blood oxygen dependent level (BOLD) signals were detected in the cerebellum during the performance of a finger tapping task where clusters of activity were observed in the ipsilateral IV-VI cerebellar lobules.<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> Other neuroimaging studies identified motor activations along the cortex and dentate nuclei of the cerebellum.<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> Interestingly, contradictory to the lower limb, face and mouth cerebellar motor representations, the upper limbs were observed to have a more scattered activation pattern.<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> This indicated that the modulation of cerebellum using ctDCS is more likely to improve upper limb functions. A vast body of evidence has focused on the role of modulation of M1 with tDCS to improve motor skills.<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> However, despite evidences highlighting the role of anterior lobe of cerebellum in motor functions<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> and deficits in motor functions with cerebellar dysfunctions,<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> the role of the cerebellum in fine manual dexterity was not investigated.

Based on the principle of CBI, it was hypothesized that anodal stimulation deteriorates the performance of fine manual dexterity and motor speed while cathodal stimulation improves the same variables. Moreover, it was hypothesized that sham stimulation had no effect on the outcome variables of fine manual dexterity and motor speed.</p><sec sec-type="methods" id="sec1-2"><title>Methods</title><p>PubMed, the Cochrane Library and Imam Abdulrahman Bin Faisal University (IAU) database (Summon) were used to search and extract research articles published in the field of ctDCS.

Subjects were excluded if they had a history of central or peripheral nervous system disease, psychiatric disorders, diabetes, pregnant during the time of the study, or if they had previously participated in a non-invasive brain stimulation technique. All subjects signed an informed consent before commencement of the experiment which was approved by the Institute Review Board (IRB) at Imam Abdulrahman bin Faisal University.

Mental fatigue level using the visual analogue scale (VAS) was utilized to rate the subject&#x02019;s fatigue level from 0-10. Any subject reporting a mental fatigue of more than 5/10 was given a break before the onset of the next task. In this study, no subjects exceeded the fatigue level of 5 and thus, no rest was needed between tasks.

These results were precisely concurrent with previous studies that investigated the effect of cerebellar modulation on motor speed. While cathodal stimulation showed no effect on the performance of FTT,<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> anodal stimulation was found to enhance the performance of the task.<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> The fact that no difference was noted between anode-cathode or cathode-sham groups proves that the effect of cathodal stimulation is not necessarily an inverse of anodal stimulation.<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> Cantarero et al<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> have previously raised the prospect that cathodal stimulation might not have a strong influence on cerebellar processes. In this study, the dominant hand showed a significantly higher motor speed than the non-dominant hand. As the non-dominant hand has a relatively slower performance than the dominant hand, there is a higher potential for improvement in performance. This has been previously explained as the &#x0201c;ceiling effect&#x0201d;, where the performance of a task can improve to a certain extent after which a plateau is reached and further improvement is not possible.<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> If an effect was to be observed, it would have been more probable if the non-dominant FTT scores improved more significantly due to the ceiling effect of the dominant hand.</p><p>Further analysis was conducted to scrutinize repeated measures pairwise comparison of scores between the 5 blocks of the dominant (D1-D5) and non-dominant (ND1-ND5) hands. In the dominant hand scores, results revealed no significant increase between the first and the second blocks. However, a highly significant increase was demonstrated in scores of the first and the second blocks in comparison to the third, fourth, and fifth blocks. This suggests that modulation of the cerebellum affected performance during the first 2 blocks where the scores were highest. Subsequently, the scores continued to decrease with no significant increase in the final blocks (D3-D5). This is consistent with a previous study that highlighted that anodal stimulation prompted a hyperpolarization block in descending cortical pathways.<xref rid="ref33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref> Therefore, anodal stimulation imposed maximum modulation of the cerebellum during the first 2 blocks after which the scores reached a plateau. Concurrent with the above findings, the non-dominant within-subjects pairwise comparison revealed a maintenance of high scores during the first 3 blocks (ND1-ND3). This emphasizes that as the non-dominant hand was less proficient in conducting the task, there was a higher potential for improvement with time. Moreover, there was no significant increase between the scores of the third, fourth, and fifth blocks (ND3-ND5). Again, this reveals that anodal stimulation modulated the cerebellum initially before attaining a hyperpolarization block.</p><p>In terms of fine manual dexterity, cerebellar modulation using ctDCS failed to show a significant effect on the performance of GPT for the dominant and non-dominant hands. This implies that the cerebellum might not have a significant contribution in modulating fine movements as compared to other cortical areas like M1. Parikh and Cole<xref rid="ref34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref> previously reported that anodal M1-tDCS demonstrated an effect on descending motor pathways by improving the performance of GPT immediately after, and 35 min post stimulation. Similarly, anodal tDCS on M1 demonstrated an online training effect on GPT while cathodal tDCS influenced offline training performance.<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> To delineate the roles of the cerebellum and the cerebral cortex, Galea et al<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> showed that cerebellar modulation using ctDCS improved motor functions.<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> Earlier neuroimaging studies also verified this by illustrating the presence of a mirrored sensorimotor homunculus along the structure of the cerebellum, representing different areas for hand and finger movements.<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> The fact that this study showed no significant effect indicates that the cerebellum might have a role in selective motor functions other than fine manual dexterity.</p><sec id="sec2-4"><title>Study limitations</title><p>The data was conducted from a single ctDCS intervention session. It was a single blinded study where only healthy subjects were recruited as a sample of convenience.</p><p>In conclusion, based on the findings of this study, cerebellum contributes to motor speed by improving the efficiency of performance. Moreover, the maximum effect observed was during the initial blocks of the task after which the performance deteriorated and reached a plateau. Furthermore, this study failed to demonstrate a modulating effect of the cerebellum on fine manual dexterity in healthy subjects. Collectively, all findings suggest that there is a distinct functional distribution of motor maps and the cerebellum does not necessarily contribute to all motor functions despite its widely scattered motor homunculus.</p><p>Future research should attempt to investigate the role of multiple sessions of ctDCS on fine manual dexterity and motor speed in health and disease. Moreover, the long-term effects of ctDCS must be explored to establish ctDCS as a valid treatment for disorders affecting both cerebellar and cortical functions.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgment</title><p>We would like to thank Editage, English Language Editing Services (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.editage.com">www.editage.com</ext-link>) for English language editing.</p></ack><fn-group><fn fn-type="financial-disclosure"><p>
