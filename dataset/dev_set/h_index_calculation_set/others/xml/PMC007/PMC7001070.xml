These patients were identified using the hospital medical records in the Health Information Coding System (ICD 09) and through a review of the pediatric clinic patient registry.</p><p>The inclusion criteria were the following: Saudi nationality; aged less than 18 years; height-for-age z score (HAZ): &#x0003c;2, following the WHO criteria; absence of GI symptoms; abnormal GH provocation test; and CeD serology performed. The exclusion criteria were the following: patients with known chronic illnesses, thyroid problems, and genetic or chromosomal abnormalities.</p><p>As noted, SS was defined according to the WHO criteria: only patients with HAZ less than 2 SD below the mean were included in the study. The z score was estimated using an anthropometric software program (EpiInfo, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, GA, USA).</p><p>Basic information retrieved from medical records comprised demographic data, weight, body mass index (BMI), and blood levels of the following: albumin, hemoglobin, calcium, phosphate, alkaline phosphatase, and vitamin D.</p><p>Celiac disease serological screening was performed in the hospital immunology laboratory using an anti-tissue transglutaminase antibody determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), utilizing the Quanta Lit tTG ELISA kit (INOVA Diagnostic Inc., San Diego, CA, USA). A negative result was reported if the tTG level was &#x0003c;20 U/ml, as instructed by the manufacturer. Total serum IgA was also measured for all patients screened using the nephelometry system (Siemens AG, Munich, Germany) to identify patients with IgA deficiency.</p><p>The diagnosis of CeD was based on European Society of Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition (ESPGHAN) criteria: having positive antibody testing to tTG, followed by small intestinal biopsy obtained through upper gastrointestinal endoscopy to confirm the diagnosis.<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> Biopsy specimens were classified according to the Marsh-Oberhuber classification.<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></p><p>The diagnosis of GHD was based on a low GH response (&#x0003c;10 ng/mL) after at least 2 different pharmacological tests in children with SS. Clonidine (150 micrograms/m<sup>2</sup> BSA orally) and glucagon (15 micrograms/kg, intramuscular) stimulation tests were performed on all patients on 2 different occasions, followed by a collection of blood samples at 0, 30, 60, 90, 120, 150, 180, and 210 minutes after stimulation. The severity of GHD was further categorized into severe GHD, in which the peak GH level was &#x02264;5 ng/mL, and partial GHD, in which the peak GH level was &#x0003e;5 and &#x0003c;10 ng/mL.</p><p>Serum insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) and IGF-binding protein 3 (IGFBP-3) levels were recorded. Serum insulin-like growth factor 1 was measured in plasma by radioimmunoassay (RIA) after acid-alcohol extraction. IGF-binding protein 3 was measured by RIA in diluted serum.</p><p>Bone age was established by performing a plain radiograph of the left hand and wrist using the Greulich and Pyle method.<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> The delay in bone age was calculated by subtracting the chronological age from the bone age in months.</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Data analysis</title><p>Data were analyzed using the Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) for Windows, version 22 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA).

Furthermore, no differences were demonstrated in the IGF-1 or IGFBP-3 levels when patients with overt CeD were compared to patients with normal biopsy.</p><p>In the study cohort, 14 (4%) patients had overt CeD. The GHD could be a result of CeD or an association of the 2 conditions. Studies of CeD patients have reported reduced GH secretion after pharmacological stimulation compared with control subjects.<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> The mechanism of impairment of hypothalamic control of GH secretion is not very clear. Malnutrition resulting from CeD could have a direct effect on the circulating gluten peptides in the brain, affecting the pituitary and hypothalamic control. The presence of circulating antibodies against the pituitary gland and the hypothalamus may suggest an autoimmune mechanism involving the pituitary gland and causing autoimmune hypophysitis that contributes to growth impairment.<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> The institution of a strict gluten-free diet (GFD) for 6-12 months usually reverses changes in the somatotrophic axis, allowing normal GH secretion and response, and thereafter normal catch-up growth for the child. A lack of response after 12 months of a strict GFD raises the possibility of a combined diagnosis of genuine GHD and CeD. The coexistence of the 2 conditions is rare and has been reported in 0.23% of children with SS.<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> Those patients often require treatment with recombinant GH to improve their linear growth.</p><p>The tTG antibody test has been reported to have higher sensitivity and specificity in screening for CeD in the absence of total IgA deficiency, and at higher cutoff values; it correlates with the severity of mucosal damage in patients with suspected CeD.<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></p><sec id="sec2-4"><title>Study limitations</title><p>The strengths of our study are: 1) we included a large number of patients with GHD over the study period, and 2) it concerns an aspect of CeD screening in growth hormone impaired children that has not been widely explored. The study, however, is limited by its retrospective nature and design. A prospective study is required to describe the longitudinal growth pattern of children with CeD and GHD after the institution of GFD.</p><p>In conclusion, we have shown a prevalence of CeD seropositivity in 13.4% and of overt CeD in 4% of children with isolated SS. However, no predictors were identified for CeD diagnosis. The finding of GHD should not preclude the search for CeD, since the majority of these patients will potentially improve with the institution of a GFD.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgment</title><p>The authors gratefully acknowledge the American Journal Experts (AJE) (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.aje.com">www.aje.com</ext-link>) for English language editing.</p></ack><fn-group><fn fn-type="financial-disclosure"><p>
