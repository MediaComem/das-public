COVID-19 was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization already in March 2020 and it is still a public health emergency of international concern <xref rid="bib0001" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. This infection has also affected social life and the global economy significantly.</p><p id="para0010">Patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 generally develop a range of symptoms, with the most common being fever, dry cough, and dyspnea <xref rid="bib0002" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. Respiratory failure and organ failures occur in severe cases. Usually, patients older than 60 years, or those with severe pre-existing ailments, are at a comparably greater risk of developing life-threatening signs <xref rid="bib0003" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. Like in other infections, laboratory tests in patients with COVID-19 indicate the presence of general inflammatory responses and specific ones reflected by immunologically active cells, specific antibodies, and the cytokine cascades that elicit these responses. Autoantibodies, that is, antibodies that react with self-antigens are not unusual in chronic infections but the initial event that leads to their initiation is unknown. Autoantibodies, including those with affinity to type I interferons (IFNs), have been found in SARS-CoV-2 infections <xref rid="bib0004" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>.</p><p id="para0011">The innate immune responses serve as a first line of antiviral defense and are essential for immunity to viruses; these responses have been shown to recognize the SARS-CoV-2 virus and activate signals governing host pattern recognition receptors, involving toll-like receptors and retinoic acid-inducible gene I-like receptors, which are of critical importance for eliciting the innate immune response that results in the production of type-I-IFN <xref rid="bib0005" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. Typically, type-I-IFNs play an important role in the defense against viruses and are associated with a broad spectrum of antiviral infections <xref rid="bib0006" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. The presence of type-I-IFN-neutralizing autoantibodies in patients with COVID-19 leads to impaired viral clearance, while patients lacking these autoantibodies can reduce their viral load over time suggesting that anti-type-I-IFN-autoantibodies weaken the ability to control viral replication [<xref rid="bib0004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="bib0007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="bib0008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. These autoantibodies could therefore play a role in modulating the severity of COVID-19 infections. Bastard et&#x000a0;al<italic>.</italic>

Another similar study found an approximately 9% positive rate of anti-type-I-IFN-autoantibodies in severe and critical patients with COVID-19 <xref rid="bib0009" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, while another research team found these autoantibodies in 5.2% of hospitalized patients with COVID-19 <xref rid="bib0004" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. The existence of this kind of autoantibodies <italic>in vivo</italic> provides a new direction for the study of host immune responses and mechanisms after SARS-CoV-2 infection, reflecting the complexity of the immune response in COVID-19 infection.</p><p id="para0012">We conducted a systemic literature review and collected a number of key papers dealing with autoantibodies against type-I-IFN associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection to be used for a meta-analysis with the aim of finding how common these autoantibodies and their subtypes are in patients with COVID-19.

The search strategy is available in supplementary materials. Two researchers independently screened each report. The inclusion criteria were: (i) subjects diagnosed with COVID-19 by the reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction or serological testing for specific antibodies; (ii) subjects tested for autoantibodies against type-I-IFN, including subtypes; and (iii) articles published in English. The exclusion criteria were articles without data relevant to the study or where the full text was not available; case reports and preprints. Moreover, we also excluded studies in which autoantibodies were not assayed for neutralization; studies that dealt with specific populations, such as patients with only severe or only mild COVID-19; only male or only female patients; patients with COVID-19 with other diseases; and patients with COVID-19 receiving unconventional or special treatment.

Some viral infections have additionally been linked to autoimmunity <xref rid="bib0017" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. Studies in the past 2 years have found an association between SARS-CoV-2 infection and host autoimmunity, with both reactivity and variety of autoantibodies significantly increased <xref rid="bib0004" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. Examples include not only anti-type-I-IFN autoantibodies of different subtypes but also general antinuclear antibodies and anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies <xref rid="bib0018" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. The presence of these autoantibodies is associated with an increased antiviral humoral immune response and a stronger inflammatory immune response than normal <xref rid="bib0019" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, which counter-intuitively can impair resistance to viral infection by inhibiting immune receptor signaling and altering the composition of the peripheral immune cells <xref rid="bib0004" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>.</p><p id="para0024">We observed that the autoantibodies against type-I-IFN reported in these studies were mainly of the anti-IFN-&#x003b1; and anti-IFN-&#x003c9; types, which are present in only 0.3% of the general population <xref rid="bib0015" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. Under appropriate conditions, anti-cytokine autoantibodies could neutralize the biological function of the target cytokines by depleting them through formation of immune complexes <xref rid="bib0020" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, however, not all autoantibodies are able to neutralize their target cytokines in this way <xref rid="bib0021" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. Because autoantibodies with neutralizing properties are more biologically relevant <xref rid="bib0020" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, we focused on those capable of neutralizing type-I-IFNs. In our analysis, these autoantibodies were more prevalent among severely ill patients; and it is thus of great significance to find them in SARS-CoV-2-infected patients with severe signs of disease.</p><p id="para0025">Age and gender influence the outcome of COVID-19, and it has been reported that infected individuals over 65 years of age as well as men (in comparison to women) are more likely to develop severe pneumonia <xref rid="bib0022" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. Our analysis showed that patients characterized by this symptom had a higher positive rate of anti-type-I-IFN-autoantibodies than less severely ill patients. Therefore, we speculate that a high level of this type of autoantibody can significantly reduce the level of type-I-IFN in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection and that these autoantibodies may be an important factor contributing to severe pneumonia (and other symptoms). Because most of them can neutralize type-I-IFN <italic>in vivo</italic> [<xref rid="bib0007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="bib0016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], deficiency of this cytokine can be considered a marker of severe COVID-19 <xref rid="bib0023" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>, which supports the idea that the presence of anti-type-I-IFN-autoantibodies constitutes a detrimental factor. Indeed, the clearance of the virus is delayed in patients with high levels of these autoantibodies because they block IFN-I signaling <xref rid="bib0008" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. These autoantibodies also hinder the activation of myeloid and lymphoid cells in response to SARS-CoV-2 infection <xref rid="bib0004" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. If anti-type-I-IFN-autoantibodies are rather the cause than the consequence of severe COVID-19, which has been suggested <xref rid="bib0004" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, it would be highly meaningful to screen for these autoantibodies in patients with COVID-19 early on. Administration of type-I-IFNs would be the treatment of choice for patients shown to produce high levels of such antibodies because it would presumably help prevent them from developing severe symptoms.</p><p id="para0026">It is worth noting that some patients with pre-existing high titers of neutralizing anti-type-I-IFN-autoantibodies, mainly young women, showed only mild symptoms after infection with SARS-CoV-2 <xref rid="bib0024" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. Although the presence of these neutralizing autoantibodies is a strong risk factor for exacerbating disease, not all patients with the antibodies develop severe or critical COVID-19 disease <xref rid="bib0013" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. Most patients with critical COVID-19 pneumonia and neutralizing autoantibodies against type-I-IFN were men over 65 years <xref rid="bib0007" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. Moreover, it has been reported that the prevalence of anti-type-I-IFN-autoantibodies increased with age [<xref rid="bib0007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="bib0013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Although we were unable to perform an age-stratified analysis because specific age data for the included patients were not available in all studies, age is an important factor that cannot be ignored because of its potential contribution to severe disease. There are gender differences in COVID-19, with male patients more commonly experiencing severe disease and higher mortality <xref rid="bib0015" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, a fact supported by our finding of a higher positive rate of anti-type-I-IFN-autoantibodies in men. Thus, it is concluded that anti-type-I-IFN-autoantibodies are more common in older and male patients, and these autoantibodies appear to be more likely to be a risk factor for severe COVID-19 in the elderly and men, but much less so in the young and women.</p><p id="para0027">Although generally autoantibody production is typical of autoimmune diseases, such as systemic lupus erythematosus and rheumatoid arthritis <xref rid="bib0025" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>, anti-type-I-IFN-autoantibodies in patients with COVID-19 are likely to have been present before infection, and such neutralizing antibodies have even been associated with an increased risk of death <xref rid="bib0026" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. Moreover, these autoantibody responses in most patients with COVID-19 are highly dynamic, peaking in the acute phase and then gradually decreasing, which is in sharp contrast to the stable high level of anti-type-I-IFN IgG in patients with autoimmune-polyendocrine-syndrome type 1 <xref rid="bib0027" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. Interestingly, in contrast, it has been suggested SARS-CoV-2 infection can lead to the emergence of new IgG anti-type-I-IFN-autoantibodies, which are positively correlated with the immune response to viral proteins <xref rid="bib0014" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. Emerging autoimmune diseases have also been observed during or after SARS-CoV-2 infection <xref rid="bib0028" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>.</p><p id="para0028">There is obviously an interaction between SARS-CoV-2 infection and autoimmunity, where the latter seems to aggravate the infection; there is then a question if severe SARS-CoV-2 infection induces autoimmunity or if it is the result of pre-existing autoantibodies and molecular mimicry induced by other infections. Molecular mimicry may be an important mechanism of autoimmunity caused by COVID-19 <xref rid="bib0017" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>; In the analysis of the SARS-CoV-2 proteome, Fath et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="bib0029" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref> found that SARS-CoV-2 and the human proteome share 23 peptides derived from the ORF1ab polyprotein, non-structural protein NS7a, surface glycoprotein, and the SARS-CoV-2 envelope protein. That these viral antigens have significant homology with human proteins can be an important reason why autoimmunity arises during COVID-19 infection. Although vaccination clearly prevents severe symptoms of the disease and helps reduce viral transmission, the autoimmune responses occurring in some individuals vaccinated against COVID-19 cannot be ignored <xref rid="bib0030" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>.</p><p id="para0029">A limitation is there may be a considerable recruitment bias as almost all the studies collected for this review were cross-sectional by design and the patients recruited were usually from a certain hospital. Therefore, it is very likely that most of the enrolled patients were hospitalized or severely ill patients, while patients with mild symptoms, or those who were not admitted to the hospital for examination, were rarely included in any studies. Although we found a significantly higher rate of anti-type-I-IFN-autoantibodies in severely ill patients, the heterogeneity that was found among the studies analyzed for this result was considerable. This may be because of the rules applied for the groups, for example, severely ill patients included &#x0201c;severe", &#x0201c;critical&#x0201d; or &#x0201c;ICU&#x0201d; patients, while the group of not severely ill patients included &#x0201c;non-ICU", &#x0201c;moderate", &#x0201c;mild&#x0201d; or &#x0201c;asymptomatic&#x0201d; patients. The difference between these two groups may not have been as rigorous as desired because different countries and regions may have different diagnostic criteria. In addition, because the research subjects in the eight studies came from various countries it could have affected immune functionality related to genetic differences making the autoimmune disease status of all patients before SARS-CoV-2 infection somewhat unclear. In addition, not all the included studies established a specific positive cut-off value for the autoantibodies in question. Therefore, we did not determine a uniform positive cut-off for the values reported but relied on the data as given in each article. It is also possible that other unreported factors contributed to the observed heterogeneity.</p><p id="para0030">In conclusion, the results of our study suggest that anti-type-I-IFN-autoantibodies in patients with COVID-19 are associated with disease severity and it is also gender-related. Importantly, there is growing evidence that COVID-19 is associated with autoimmunity, but several questions remain. They include the specific mechanism of anti-type-I-IFN-autoantibody production in patients with COVID-19 and how these autoantibodies regulate the disease process. With reference to the IFN subtype, further studies are needed to find the reason why the autoantibodies against IFN-&#x003b1; and IFN-&#x003c9; are more common while those against IFN-&#x003b2; are rare. Finally, it is also necessary to find out if there is a way to neutralize the development of autoimmunity after COVID-19 infection (and also after vaccination), so that COVID-19 can be effectively prevented and controlled.</p></sec><sec sec-type="COI-statement"><title>Declaration of competing interest</title><p id="para0032">The authors have no competing interests to declare.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list id="cebibl1"><title>References</title><ref id="bib0001"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="other" id="tboref0001">World Health Organization.
