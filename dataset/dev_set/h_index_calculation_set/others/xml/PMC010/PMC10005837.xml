Although successful vaccines have enabled our lives to trend back toward prior routines and patterns, no one has been immune to the social and psychological impacts imposed by the pandemic. Many of us are now finding that there is no &#x0201c;normal&#x0201d; to return to. Jessica Stern, in her memoir, writes about the impact of trauma: &#x0201c;Some people&#x02019;s lives seem to flow in a narrative, mine had many stops and starts. That&#x02019;s what trauma does, it interrupts the plot&#x0201d; [<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. The COVID-19 pandemic and the associated burnout pandemic among medical providers has been a force large enough to temporarily freeze &#x0201c;the plot&#x0201d; of self-actualization and professional development for many of us. Our narratives for the past several years, in many cases, have been primarily focused on actions that are related to surviving rather than thriving. From a physiology perspective, trauma hijacks our body&#x02019;s story from one of peace and rest to one of anxiety and stress. Hypervigilance limits our capacity to engage with life&#x02019;s opportunities and challenges from an adaptive perspective. In the setting of collective trauma, a new&#x000a0;paradigm surrounding healing and transformation is emerging as it relates to physician burnout. This article presents strategies in which healing and restoration focus on deep connection&#x02014;to one another, to meaning and purpose, to our own bodies as vessels in which transformation begins, and to our capacity to lead within our families, communities and practice environments independent of our titles or other external markers of power and position.</p></sec><sec id="sec2"><title>Recovering the Plot (Relate, Resonate, Restore)</title><p id="p0015">The impact of the autonomic nervous system on the lived human experience is profound. The regulation or dysregulation of this system creates the platform upon which the most compelling aspects of our humanity, our thoughts and stories, emotions, and attention, are blended into the self. If we consider an aspect of burnout to be a maladaptive sustained sympathetic nervous system response to chronic workplace stress, then strategies to regulate the autonomic nervous system in the form of a felt sense of calm and connectedness will be a necessary first step toward personal transformation. The COVID-19 pandemic, coupled with widespread burnout among health care providers, presented our already taxed nervous systems with threats or perceived threats to life while simultaneously compromising one of our most valuable resources in regulating our autonomic physiology&#x02014;the Social Engagement System (SES), [<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. The following sections outline a path toward a return to calm and connected rather than fight-or-flight.</p><sec id="sec2.1"><title>Relate</title><p id="p0020">The SES is a critical component of the Polyvagal Theory (PVT) developed by Stephen Porges, PhD. PVT is a theoretical construct asserting that the vagus nerve operates through two distinct anatomic pathways (dorsal and ventral) with the ventral vagal function critical in mitigating stress responses and fight-or-flight physiology [<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. The ventral vagus functionality is achieved through a myelinated mammalian pathway that innervates striated muscles of the face and neck and gastrointestinal tract as well as the heart and bronchi. The ventral vagal system is thought to mediate the physiologic calming effect of social connection whereby human beings attune to one another and gain a felt sense of safety through prosodic vocalization and patterns of facial expression that calm and co-regulation the nervous system [<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. This is intuitively felt when one is in the company of cherished and trusted friends, family, or pets and has been a critical component of our evolution as social animals [<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. PVT hypothesizes that without active engagement of the SES, our nervous systems&#x02019; response to acute stress and fear triggers can become sustained and maladaptive manifesting as anxiety, irritability, and disconnection [<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Additionally, the social distancing imperatives of the pandemic have compromised our ability and opportunities to exercise the SES [<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. In modern health care, providers are faced with myriad system-based challenges that can act as threats to safety, and these threats can be understood as mediated through a process that Porges has termed &#x0201c;nociception,&#x0201d; a felt sense of danger that humans register at a subconscious level that results in autonomic nervous system activation [<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. For radiologists, this might manifest as stress and anxiety related to a complex clinical caseload, moral distress, skill set mismatched with scope of practice, chronic understaffing, lack of autonomy, or long work hours [<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. A human being who is chronically triggered into a persistent sympathetic state of fight-or-flight is not capable of transforming self or system. Their plot, so to speak, becomes reduced to one of survival. If we view burnout as a manifestation of extreme disconnection (from our emotions, sense of accomplishment and meaning, and well as from our own bodies and experiences in the form of depersonalization), then the process of connection, as outlined by PVT, becomes of particular importance as a framework for institutional and individual resilience strategies in a para pandemic world that has ushered in widespread negative impacts on well-being [<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>].</p><p id="p0025">A practical approach to optimizing social connection and vagal tone through the SES is offered by Deb Dana, PhD, in her book <italic>Polyvagal Exercises for Safety and Connection</italic>. She presents an exercise that guides individuals through a process of social cluster mapping. This is intended to help us identify the who, what, when, where, and why of our social networks and therefore amplify our calming social resources. These practices, as outlined in detail by Dr. Dana are adapted from her work and expertise and are further described and outlined in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;1</xref>

The art of fine-tuning our social network may seem intuitive but in a fast- paced parapandemic world in which our &#x0201c;socialization muscles&#x0201d; have become deconditioned, a strategic plan for practicing social re-engagement with the right people at the right time is a powerful step toward nervous system regulation.<fig id="fig1"><label>Fig.&#x000a0;1</label><caption><p>Cluster of connection.

Of the five primary emotions (fear, anger, sadness, disgust, and joy), only joy is a positive emotion with related spectrum emotions including awe and wonder, gratitude, and compassion [<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Humans have a negativity bias, which has been amplified by the COVID-19 pandemic, whereby we are primed toward looking for and experiencing emotions that are threatening and fear based and that stimulate the sympathetic nervous systems response [<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Simultaneously calming our nervous systems through positive affect, as well as connecting to meaning and purpose through the pleasurable experience of being alive, can be achieved in numerous ways, and gratitude practices have been shown to have a positive impact on well-being [<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Importantly, there is evidence that self-transcendent states can be transformed into lasting desired traits through the development of neuroplasticity [<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>].

In this way, if we become aware of the moments during which our systems enter a fight-or-flight physiological state, then we become empowered to regulate those systems back to a state of safe, calm, and connectedness [<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. As radiologists, we might pay attention to our body&#x02019;s response to interpreting a complex CT scan when we are less certain of the diagnosis as opposed to the impact of reading a more routine, less challenging examination. In the former case, our heart rate might increase and we may begin to fidget, to tighten our muscles, to hold our breath. Upon noticing our body&#x02019;s response patterns, we can choose to partner with our physiology in the moment toward regulation. There are many ways through the lens of PVT to bring the parasympathetic system back online. In this scenario, one could discuss the case with a trusted colleague, connect with the joy in the learning process or to the detective and discovery work of examining the medical literature, or attune to any immediately available impulses toward pleasure such as taking a 5-min break to go outdoors and appreciate the physical pleasure of the warmth of the sun. Perhaps more simply, randomized controlled trials suggest that we do have the power to disengage the sympathetic and turn on the SES by smiling in the face of stress [<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>].</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec3"><title>Posttraumatic Growth and the Process of Transformation</title><p id="p0040">In a <italic>Harvard Business Review</italic> article titled &#x0201c;The Real Reason People Won&#x02019;t Change,&#x0201d; the authors discuss the way in which unconscious and competing commitments and outdated mental models limit personal growth [<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. In their model, if a radiologist were passionate about a quality improvement project but engaging in that project would require conflict management skills necessary to work with colleagues and administrators, then a subconscious commitment to avoid conflict might override the impulse toward systems improvement and the status quo would remain for the radiologist and the system. Human beings are designed to create working mental models of the world that are inherently limited based upon one&#x02019;s personality, experiences, attitudes, and preferences. In other words, we often create a story about the world that we find tolerable. However, this story can be based on assumptions rather than objective data and operates merely to keep us safe in the same old story. Transformation often asks us to let go of our old stories and step into new ones. The paradox becomes, if we are unconscious of our biases and mental models, how do we find our way out of this dark metaphorical cardboard box? Research from the field of posttraumatic growth lends relevance to this discussion through the lens of the potentiating challenges overcome and lessons learned as a consequence of the collective traumatic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.</p><p id="p0045">The idea of positive transformation is weaved into religious texts, poetry, and painting. Whether it is the Phoenix rising from the ashes or the old adage in Kelly Clarkson&#x02019;s lyrics &#x0201c;what doesn&#x02019;t kill you, makes you stronger,&#x0201d; the sentiment remains clear&#x02014;it is possible to transcend the circumstances and grow in the aftermath of trauma. The Post Traumatic Growth (PTG) theory postulates that a traumatic experience results in the shattering of one&#x02019;s core belief systems and disruption of basic assumptions about the world (ie, a nonvoluntary tearing down of the metaphorical cardboard box) [<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. In this way, the COVID-19 pandemic has ushered in a potentially radical platform for personal and collective transformation by forcing us to recognize our outdated mental models and step into change through a more flexible worldview. The PTG scale was developed to assess the impact of traumatic experiences on growth, and it contains questions across the domains of personal strength, improved relationships, heightened appreciation for life, ability to see new possibilities, and spiritual growth [<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. If we return to the example of the radiologist with the competing commitments of being conflict avoidant and desiring to engage in meaningful work, it may be that the pandemic propelled the radiologist to successfully advocate for his or her personal safety, and this action challenged the radiologist&#x02019;s invalid mental model that he or she could not manage conflict or effect change within a health care system, thus enabling him or her to step into a greater storyline of self.</p><p id="p0050">Reflecting upon the ways in which the COVID-19 pandemic has impacted our mental models and illuminated our competing commitments regarding the process of transformation may be undertaken by reviewing the PTG inventory (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#x000a0;3</xref>
). Furthermore, studies have shown that core positive beliefs about the world and about others has helped to sustain post traumatic growth, specifically when assessed relative to the COVID-19 pandemic. This underscores the importance of simultaneously cultivating connection by engaging the SES and engaging in practices that promote positive emotion [<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. When we see ourselves as capable of transformation through the process of the dissolution and restructuring of self, we become less committed to repetitive and limited narratives and can engage with life from a perspective that better considers both the positive and the negative aspects of change.<fig id="fig3"><label>Fig.&#x000a0;3</label><caption><p>The PTGI consists of 21 statements, each falling under one of the five domains of growth described by Tedeschi and Calhoun in their 1995 publication [<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>].</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="gr3_lrg"/></fig></p></sec><sec id="sec4"><title>A Word About Transformational Leadership</title><p id="p0055">&#x0201c;Your leadership story is your life story,&#x0201d; says the Fortune 500 chief executive officer Doug Conan [<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. We all have a leadership story to be lived and learned from. In this worldview, leadership is not actualized by the attainment of a corner office or a promotion to the C-suite. Transformational leaders often emerge in times of crisis and are defined as those individuals with self-awareness, balanced processing of relevant information, a strong internal moral compass, and relational transparency [<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. These leadership qualities are all supported through the processes for transformation discussed previously. However, in a larger sense, transformational leaders do not exclusively see the world through a commodified and binary perspective. For example, is there a direct cost-benefit equation for taking the time to listen to a colleague&#x02019;s patient safety concerns? Can one quantify a bottom line as it relates to speaking frankly about one&#x02019;s limitations and fears? Ian McNeil developed an economic theory positing that an organization develops relationships with other entities by using either a transactional or relational approach. The former focuses on short- term and individual issues and the latter is based on long- term objectives [<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. The sustainability of our health care systems depends on the long- term relationships between patients, providers, and health care leadership. If we are to emerge from burnout, we must become transformational leaders in our own lives, living a leadership story with the capacity to regulate our nervous system and foster connection with colleagues, while recognizing that transformation cannot be reduced to the transactional.</p></sec><sec id="sec5"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="p0060">There is no one- size- fits- all formula for personal transformation. However, the COVID-19 pandemic has created conditions whereby healing and growth can no longer be viewed on the merely personal level but must be relational and ecological in perspective. Physician burnout is no longer a viable option for individual providers, for patients, or for the systems we serve. It is only when these interconnected and <italic>relational</italic> aspects of well-being and healing begin to align rather than compete that sustained change becomes possible. In the meantime, the task ahead is a hard one. In the end, it will be transformed individuals that are capable of transforming systems. The COVID-19 pandemic has been a collective trauma that has highlighed both human strength and resilience and has shown us that, in the words of the feminist author and thought leader Glennon Doyle, &#x0201c;We can do hard things&#x0201d; [<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec6"><title>Take-Home Points</title><p id="p0065">
