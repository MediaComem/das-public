Even though diagnosis of this bleeding disorder is rarely established among children and adolescents, AHA may lead to severe, life-threatening hemorrhage in this age group, and therefore it requires special caution.</p></sec><sec><title>Case report</title><p>19 year old primigravida with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection was admitted to hospital due to prolonged vaginal bleeding six weeks postpartum. All gynaecological causes of uterine bleeding were excluded, Foley catheter was placed, but the bleeding still persisted. Coagulation tests revealed isolated deranged aPTT values. Further haematology evaluation demonstrated factor VIII deficiency, presence of factor VIII inhibiting factors, and the diagnosis of AHA was proposed. The anti-inhibitor coagulant complex drug was introduced and patient has responded positively to the treatment.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Due to disturbance of immune system, pregnancy and postpartum period represent predilection time for AHA development. Furthermore, viral infection in pregnancy, such as COVID-19, might be considered as an additional risk factor for AHA development and several reported cases of AHA after COVID-19 infection support this hypothesis. Even though AHA is a rare disease, due to its high mortality rate of more than 20%, it should be considered in all cases of unusual bleeding of unknown cause in all age groups.</p><p>Publication of this case report is approved by Institutional Review Board.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group id="keys0001"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>acquired haemophilia A</kwd><kwd>coagulation disorders</kwd><kwd>pregnancy</kwd><kwd>postpartum</kwd><kwd>adolescence</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="sec0001"><title>References</title><p id="para0005">
