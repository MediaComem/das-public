The biggest prevalence of adolescent pregnancies in Europe can be found in southeastern countries.</p></sec><sec><title>Objectives</title><p>to analyze the features and outcomes of adolescent deliveries during the COVID-19 pandemic.</p></sec><sec><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>retrospective, descriptive study of adolescent mothers delivered in the period 01.01.2020&#x02013;31.12.2021 in two university medical centers: the Emergency Clinical County Hospital of Arad (Romania), and Clinic of Gynecology and Obstetrics of University Clinical Center of Vojvodina (Serbia). Demographic and anthropometric parameters of adolescent mothers, number and way of delivery, birth weight and Apgar score of neonate, COVID-19 status and data about pathologies and complications associated with pregnancy and delivery were collected from medical records and analyzed statistically using IBM SPSS.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>there were total of 458 adolescent mothers, aged between 12 and 17 (average 16.07&#x000b1;1.07 year). From urban environment there were 182 (60.3%) cases and from rural 276 (39.7%) cases. Number of previous pregnancies and births ranged from 0-3, with majority of mothers being primiparas (76.2%). Cesarean section was performed in 40.8%, vaginal birth in 59.2%. The most common indications for cesarean section were maternal-pelvic disproportion, transverse lie or deflected cephalic presentation, twin pregnancies, severe fetal distress, preeclampsia, scarred uterus with risk of rupture and premature placental abruption. The average fetal weight at birth was 3010.22g ranging from 860 to 4500 g. The average Apgar score was 8.73. There were 9.66% of premature labors. There were 9 (2%) positive COVID-19 cases at birth and additional 4 (0.9%) cases who had COVID-19 during pregnancy. We observed a very high percentage (73.86%) of pregnancies without adequate prenatal care.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Adolescent mothers are prone to develop complications compared to general population. The COVID-19 pandemic might have additional negative influence on the addressability of underage mothers to medical care, this phenomenon being the basis of most complications during pregnancy. Effective interventions, better sexual education and social programs are needed to reduce the number of adolescent mothers and to help them get a much better social reinsertion and an increase in the general quality of life.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group id="keys0001"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>adolescent</kwd><kwd>pregnancy</kwd><kwd>delivery</kwd><kwd>outcome</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="sec0001"><title>References</title><p id="para0006">
