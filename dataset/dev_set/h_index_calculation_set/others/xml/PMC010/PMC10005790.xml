We aimed to examine adolescent mental health and substance use as well as covariates associated with these outcomes 1 year or more into the pandemic.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>A nationwide sample of adolescents aged 13&#x02013;18 years enrolled in school in Iceland were invited to complete surveys administered during October&#x02013;November or February&#x02013;March, 2018, October&#x02013;November, 2020, February&#x02013;March or October&#x02013;November, 2021, and February&#x02013;March 2022. The survey was in Icelandic for all administrations and offered to adolescents aged 13&#x02013;15 years in English in 2020 and 2022 and in Polish in 2022. Surveys assessed depressive symptoms (Symptom Checklist-90); mental wellbeing (Short Warwick Edinburgh Mental Wellbeing Scale); and the frequency of cigarette smoking, e-cigarette use, and alcohol intoxication. Covariates comprised age, gender, and migration status as determined by language spoken at home, level of social restrictions based on residency, parental social support, and sleep duration (&#x02265;8 h nightly). Weighted mixed-effect models were used to determine the effect of time and the covariates on mental health and substance use. The main outcomes were assessed in all participants with more than 80% of the necessary data, and multiple imputation was used to handle missing data. Bonferroni corrections were used to adjust for multiple testing and analyses were considered significant at a p value of &#x0003c;0&#x000b7;0017.</p></sec><sec><title>Findings</title><p>64&#x02009;071 responses were submitted and analysed between 2018 and 2022. Elevated depressive symptoms and worsened mental wellbeing across girls and boys aged 13&#x02013;18 years were observed to have been maintained up to 2 years into the pandemic (p&#x0003e;0&#x000b7;0017). Alcohol intoxication initially decreased during the pandemic but increased again as social restrictions eased (p&#x0003c;0&#x000b7;0001). No changes were observed in cigarette smoking and e-cigarette use during the COVID-19 pandemic. Higher levels of parental social support and an average sleep duration of 8 h or more per night were associated with mental health better outcomes and less substance use (p&#x0003c;0&#x000b7;0001). Social restrictions and migration background were inconsistently associated with the outcomes.</p></sec><sec><title>Interpretation</title><p>Population-level prevention targeting adolescent depressive symptoms should be prioritised in health policy in the wake of COVID-19.</p></sec><sec><title>Funding</title><p>Icelandic Research Fund.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="cesec10"><title>Introduction</title><p id="para10">Establishing the potential mental health consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic is a public health research priority.<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr"><sup>1</sup></xref> The need for high-quality data across the population to address this concern has been highlighted, particularly for vulnerable groups.<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> The accumulating global research indicates an increase in mental health problems<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr"><sup>4</sup></xref> and a decrease in substance use<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr"><sup>5</sup></xref> among adolescents, especially girls and older youth, during the initial waves of the COVID-19 pandemic.

<bold>Evidence before this study</bold>
</p><p id="para50">We searched PubMed and Google Scholar for peer-reviewed papers published from Jan 1, 2020, to Oct 20, 2022, with the language restricted to English. We paired the terms &#x0201c;COVID-19&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;coronavirus&#x0201d;, and &#x0201c;pandemic&#x0201d; with &#x0201c;mental health&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;psych*&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;depress*&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;substance use&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;alcohol&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;cigarette&#x0201d;, and &#x0201c;e-cigarette&#x0201d;. In addition to this search, to identify the demographics and clinical characteristics of young people at risk of poor mental health outcomes during the pandemic, we added the following terms to our search: &#x0201c;risk&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;protective&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;ethnicity&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;social support&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;sleep&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;long-term&#x0201d;, and &#x0201c;longitudinal&#x0201d;. These findings were then restricted to the following population: &#x0201c;adolescen*&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;child*&#x0201d;, and &#x0201c;youth&#x0201d;. Additional relevant references on child and adolescent mental health outcomes during the pandemic were found by checking the citations from the identified papers. Since early 2020, a plethora of research has showed an increase in mental health problems and decrease in substance use among adolescents during the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic, but few studies have examined the longer-term effects. Some studies suggest that, 1 year or more into the COVID-19 pandemic, female gender, older adolescents, migration background, and high levels of governmental social restrictions are associated with poorer adolescent outcomes, whereas social support and healthy sleep patterns are associated with better mental health during the pandemic, although the findings have not been consistent across studies. The generalisability of these studies is also limited by small sample sizes, non-representative samples, and missing pre-pandemic information. Only one population-based, repeated cross-sectional study done in Norway (n=227&#x02009;258) has tracked depressive symptoms, cigarette smoking, and alcohol intoxication among adolescents aged 13&#x02013;18 years from 2014 to 2021. This study indicated a persistent increase in depressive symptoms and decreased alcohol intoxication, but no change in cigarette smoking. The negative effects during the pandemic were more pronounced in girls and younger adolescents than in boys and older adolescents.</p><p id="para60">
<bold>Added value of this study</bold>
</p><p id="para70">To our knowledge, the current study is among the first population-based, repeated cross-sectional studies to date to examine mental health problems and substance use among adolescents aged 13&#x02013;18 years 1&#x02013;2 years into the COVID-19 pandemic and covariates associated with these outcomes. We found that the increases in depressive symptoms and poorer mental wellbeing observed within the first year of the pandemic were maintained 1&#x02013;2 years into the pandemic. After the initial decline in substance use during the first year of the pandemic, the prevalence of alcohol intoxication appears to be on the rise as social restrictions have been eased. The initial decrease in cigarette smoking and e-cigarette use within the first year of the pandemic remained stable 1&#x02013;2 years into the pandemic. The level of social restrictions and migration background were not consistently associated with adolescent mental health and substance use during the pandemic. Parental social support and sleep duration were associated with more positive outcomes, especially among boys aged 13&#x02013;15 years. Our findings also suggest that in-person contact with peers is more strongly associated with good mental health among adolescent girls than boys.</p><p id="para80">
<bold>Implications of all the available evidence</bold>
</p><p id="para90">Accumulating evidence from high-income countries indicates the persistence of an increase in mental health problems among adolescents during the pandemic, whereas knowledge on the mental health of adolescents during the pandemic in low-income and middle-income countries is limited. Without robust evidence for vulnerable subgroups, policy makers should consider implementing large-scale, global, evidence-based prevention efforts prioritising depressive symptoms in adolescents to mitigate the negative effect of the pandemic. Additionally, further monitoring of the increase in alcohol intoxication rates following the ease of social restrictions is needed to assess the need for prevention or treatment efforts.</p></boxed-text>

We also aimed to examine potential covariates (ie, level of social restrictions, immigration status, parental social support, and average duration of nightly sleep) associated with mental health outcomes and substance use in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic. Given that age and gender have most consistently been associated with adolescent outcomes during the pandemic,<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr"><sup>4</sup></xref> we examined the association between each covariate and outcome by age and gender.

All estimates were adjusted with poststratification weights to account for gender and age distribution differences between the sample and that of Iceland. In creating the post-stratification weights, participants were weighted to match the proportion of those aged 13&#x02013;18 years in Iceland within their given age group (age [in years] 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, and 18) and gender (female, male, and non-binary) using population data from Statistics Iceland. Given our study design and high response rates, the age and gender distribution of our sample was similar to the proportion of the population of 13&#x02013;18-year-olds in Iceland for the years the surveys were administered (ie, 2018, 2020, 2021, and 2022). For example, the age distribution in our sample was 34&#x000b7;5% for 13-year-olds, 33&#x000b7;9% for 14-year-olds, and 31&#x000b7;6% for 15-year-olds compared with 34&#x000b7;2% for 13-year-olds, 32&#x000b7;2% for 14-year-olds, and 32&#x000b7;7% for 15-year-olds in the general population. Similarly, gender distribution in our sample was 48&#x000b7;3% girls, 50&#x000b7;3% boys, and 1&#x000b7;4% non-binary compared with 47&#x000b7;5% girls, 50&#x000b7;5% boys, and 2&#x000b7;0% for youth identifying as non-binary in the general population of 13&#x02013;15-year-olds.

In the first model, we examined the differential effect of the pandemic by chronological age and gender by entering the main and interactive effects of time, age, and gender as fixed effects for each outcome.

This increase in adolescent mental health problems was consistent across gender. Notably, the increase in mental health problems was maintained despite the easing of social restrictions and successful vaccination campaigns, with more than 80% of the population (aged 5 years and older) in Iceland being fully vaccinated.<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr"><sup>17</sup></xref> The findings underline that adolescence is a sensitive period in which universal stress exposure is likely to trigger mental health problems,<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> which persist when left untreated.<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> Importantly, adolescent depressive symptoms are linked to reduced quality of life and are a strong predictor of later major depression.<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> Hence, large-scale, evidence-based prevention efforts, such as school-based programmes<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> targeting depressive symptoms, might be necessary.</p><p id="para360">By contrast with previous findings,<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, <xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> we found that the decrease in cigarette smoking and e-cigarette use across age groups observed within the first year of the pandemic was maintained 1&#x02013;2 years into the pandemic across age groups and gender. The social restrictions implemented during the pandemic might have led to fewer adolescents initiating nicotine use in 2020, with the consequence of fewer youth developing the habit of smoking after the social restrictions were eased in 2021 and 2022. Alternatively, other recent trends in nicotine use, such as the use of nicotine pouches, might have replaced cigarette smoking and e-cigarette use.</p><p id="para370">Among those aged 16&#x02013;18 years, rates of alcohol intoxication decreased in 2020 but returned to pre-pandemic levels in 2021. These findings were at odds with our hypothesis but might not necessarily reflect a cause for concern given that occasional alcohol consumption among 16&#x02013;18-year-old adolescents can be considered a sign of a normal social life in Nordic countries. This increase might represent a transient peak in alcohol intoxication in response to social restrictions being eased. However, the combination of increased rates of mental health problems and alcohol intoxication is of concern as substance use might serve as a mechanism to cope with poorer mental health. Future research to closely monitor this relationship is warranted.</p><p id="para380">By contrast with our hypothesis regarding the covariates and previous findings,<xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, <xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> neither migration status nor the level of social restriction were consistently associated with adolescent mental health and substance use throughout the pandemic. However, parental social support and getting at least 8 h of nightly sleep on average were robustly associated with better mental health and lower levels of substance use, although adolescents reporting high parental support and healthy sleeping patterns still experienced an increase in mental health problems, e-cigarette use, and alcohol intoxication 1&#x02013;2 years into the pandemic. Our findings also provide insight into ways to promote good mental health among certain subgroups according to gender and age. For example, high parental social support and healthy sleeping patterns were particularly protective against depressive symptoms and e-cigarette use among boys aged 13&#x02013;15 years once the social restrictions of the pandemic were eased. Furthermore, compared with girls with higher levels of parental support, girls aged 13&#x02013;15 years with lower levels of parental social support reported an improvement in mental wellbeing as social restrictions were eased. This finding was not observed among boys. Similarly, girls aged 16&#x02013;18 years, and girls living in the capital area, where there were greater social restrictions and higher incidence of COVID-19 cases, reported higher levels of mental wellbeing once the social restrictions had been lifted than girls of the same age living outside of the greater Reykjavik capital area. These findings might highlight differences in the social patterns and needs of adolescent girls and boys, suggesting that girls rely more on in-person contact with peers for social support than adolescent boys.</p><p id="para390">Strengths of this study include its nationwide sample and cross-sectional design. Our use of self-report measures constitutes both a strength and a limitation, because most adolescent mental health problems and behaviours are not documented in the health-care system. However, although our previous work has linked self-reported depressive symptoms to the frequency of visits to paediatric psychiatrists and clinical child psychologists,<xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr"><sup>30</sup></xref> we cannot determine whether the increases in depressive symptoms and substance use have reached clinically meaningful levels. Consistent with previous studies, our global subjective measure of sleep duration was robustly associated with lower mental health problems and substance use, providing partial validity for this measure. Nevertheless, future studies could incorporate daily sleep diaries and actigraphy to improve measurement precision. Caution is also advised in interpreting the association between sleep and depressive symptoms given that sleep disturbances are a symptom of depression. However, the findings might suggest that maintaining a stable daily routine, such as an 8 h or more nightly sleep schedule, could promote good mental health in times of stress. Differences in survey method (ie, offline <italic>vs</italic> online administrations) influencing pre-pandemic and post-pandemic ratings cannot be excluded.<xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr"><sup>31</sup></xref> Finally, our findings are not generalisable to 16&#x02013;18-year-olds not enrolled in secondary schools (5&#x02013;20% of the population of Iceland, with dropout rates increasing with age), who might be at higher risk for mental health problems and substance use, and the 10&#x02013;39% of eligible 16&#x02013;18-year-old adolescents who opted out of the survey or were not present at the time of survey administration.</p><p id="para400">In conclusion, this population-based, repeated cross-sectional study showed that the increases in depressive symptoms and poorer mental wellbeing observed among Icelandic adolescents within the first year of the pandemic were maintained 1&#x02013;2 years into the pandemic. The decrease in cigarette smoking and e-cigarette use within the first year of the pandemic remained stable; however, alcohol intoxication rates appeared to be on the rise. Parental social support and sleep duration were associated with more positive outcomes during the pandemic. Without robust evidence for vulnerable subgroups, large-scale, global, evidence-based prevention efforts targeting depressive symptoms in adolescents are needed to mitigate the negative effects of the pandemic. Additionally, further monitoring of the increase in alcohol intoxication rates following the ease of social restrictions is required to assess the need for prevention or treatment efforts.</p></sec><sec sec-type="data-availability" id="cesec90"><title>Data sharing</title><p id="para430">This manuscript was prepared in accordance with the STROBE statement and a detailed description of the study protocol, self-report measures used in this study, and the STROBE checklist can be found in the <xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix (p 13)</xref>.

We also acknowledge and thank all the adolescents who diligently participate in the Youth in Iceland surveys yearly or biennially. TH would also like to thank Cristiana Cruceanu and Natalie Matosin for their invaluable guidance, support, and encouragement.</p></sec></ack><ack><title>Contributors</title><p>TH and IET conceived the research question and designed the study. IET, along with the personnel at Icelandic Centre for Social Research and Analysis, identified the measures used in the surveys in 2018, 2020, 2021, and 2022, and coordinated the administration to all schools in Iceland. TH and IET accessed the data in the study and verified the underlying data. TH, GA, and SYO completed the literature review. TH completed the data analyses and drafted the manuscript, with support from IET, JPA, and HBV. All authors read and approved the final manuscript. All authors confirm they had full access to all the data in the study and accept responsibility for the decision to submit for publication.</p></ack></back></article>
