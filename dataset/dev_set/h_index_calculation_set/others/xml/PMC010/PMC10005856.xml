The recent 2022 mpox outbreak has involved widespread atypical presentations. Infected patients requiring surgery can increase the exposure of health care professionals and other patients to the virus. As it is a relatively new infectious disease internationally, there is less familiarity in managing this risk, especially in the surgical and anesthesia setting. This paper aims to provide information about mpox and how to manage suspected or confirmed cases.</p></sec><sec><title>Source</title><p id="Par2">Various authorities such as the World Health Organization, Infection Prevention and Control Canada, Public Health Agency of Canada, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (USA), and the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (Singapore) have recommended that public health and hospital systems prepare to recognize, isolate, and care for suspected and confirmed cases appropriately, as well as manage any possible exposure of staff and patients.</p></sec><sec><title>Principal findings</title><p id="Par3">Local authorities and hospitals should set up protocols for health care providers (HCPs) to minimize nosocomial transmission and risk to HCPs. Antivirals used in patients with more severe disease may cause renal or hepatic impairment and thus anesthetic drug pharmacology. Anesthesiologists and surgeons should be able to recognize mpox, and work with local infection control and epidemiologic programs to familiarize themselves with relevant infection prevention guidelines.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par4">Essential measures include clear protocols for transferring and managing surgical patients who are suspected or confirmed to be infected with the virus. Care in use of personal protective equipment and handling contaminated material is necessary to prevent inadvertent exposure. Risk stratification after exposure should be done to determine need for post-exposure prophylaxis for staff.

It is endemic to Central and West Africa and has recently been renamed by the International Committee of Taxonomy of Viruses to monkeypox Clade I and Clade II. Clade I, found mainly in the Congo Basin, is associated with increased severity and a case fatality ratio (CFR) of approximately 11%. Clade II, previously named West African Clade, is milder with fewer deaths, a CFR of about 3%, and fewer human-to-human transmissions than Clade I.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup> Clade II is further subdivided into two subclades (IIa and IIb), with subclade IIb being attributed to the group of variants circulating in the 2022 global outbreak.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup> With the increased incidence of mpox outside of Africa alongside slight changes in the viral genome, experts have proposed that subclade IIb be renamed Clade III.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup></p><p id="Par10">After almost four decades without human cases, Nigeria reported an outbreak of Clade II in 2017,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup> which continues until now. From 2018 to 2021, sporadic cases of mpox were reported from travelers from Nigeria to other countries, including Israel, Singapore, the UK, and the USA. There was also a zoonotic outbreak in 2003 involving infected prairie dogs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup> Until this year, there was no sustained human-to-human transmission over multiple viral generations outside Africa.</p><p id="Par11">In May 2022, the World Health Organization reported the first outbreak of mpox outside Africa with ongoing, sustained human-to-human transmission. These cases have mainly but not exclusively involved men who have sex with men (MSM), especially those having multiple partners within sexual networks. Nevertheless, anyone can potentially become infected with mpox as evidenced by documented household transmission of these initial cases without sexual intercourse. As of 15 November 2022, the outbreak has involved more than 79,600 patients in more than 110 countries. One hundred and three of these territories had not reported mpox cases prior to this outbreak.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup> Although, it is yet unclear if this seemingly increased transmissibility is due to mutations in the virus, a Portuguese study reported that the current strain has diverged from the 2017 Clade II with more mutations than expected, including ones that may increase its transmissibility.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup></p><p id="Par12">With the relaxation of SARS-CoV-2 border closures coupled with increased community transmission of the mpox virus, there is an expected increased incidence of patients with mpox requiring surgery and therefore anesthesia. There is currently a dearth in the guidelines on the management of mpox patients as related to anesthesia, which often requires aerosol-generating procedures (AGPs) and close contact with patients. We embarked on a narrative review of various literature from previous and current outbreaks to provide a tailored set of recommendations on managing surgical patients with suspected or confirmed mpox.</p><sec id="Sec2"><title>Transmission</title><p id="Par13">Prior to 2022, transmission from person-to-person was infrequent, requiring close and sustained contact, typically within a household setting. The mpox virus is transmitted in the following ways, listed in order of likelihood:<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup> 1) direct transmission or contact with skin lesions, which contain the highest viral load among all bodily samples, scabs, or bodily fluids of infected patients; 2) indirect transmission via fomites contaminated with infectious material from a patient&#x02019;s bodily fluids or sores; 3) respiratory droplets, which require close face-to-face contact, usually more than three hours duration and less than two meters apart; and, 4) transplacental from a pregnant woman to the fetus.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup></p><p id="Par14">As of now, the mpox virus is considered to be primarily transmitted through contact and respiratory droplets, although airborne spread has been postulated. Airborne spread involves microdroplets that weigh much less than respiratory droplets, and can stay suspended for a longer time or travel with air currents. The contribution of airborne spread requires further research but at this time it does not appear to be a primary mode of transmission.</p><p id="Par15">Although airborne spread is not the primary mode of transmission, the prolonged close proximity and AGPs common in anesthesia such as mask ventilation and intubation can potentially increase the risk of transmission to health care providers (HCPs).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup> Airborne precautions require the use of N95 masks or higher respirators, while droplet precautions require the use of surgical masks.</p><p id="Par16">It is unclear from the most recent May 2022 outbreak whether mpox can be sexually transmitted or if transmission is due to prolonged physical contact.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup> Viral DNA has been detected in the semen of infected individuals. There was one reported case of transmission after more casual, nonsexual contact at a crowded outdoor concert in the current outbreak as well.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup> These appear to suggest possible increase in transmissibility of the current mpox virus.</p><p id="Par17">In endemic areas, transmission of the mpox virus to HCPs is well documented.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup> Nonetheless, it is reassuring that transmission to HCPs in well-resourced settings is rare, with only two reported transmissions between 2020 and May 2022, with the latest occurring after a needlestick injury.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup> This might point towards significant reduction in transmission risk with the adequate use of personal protective equipment (PPE).</p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Infectiousness</title><p id="Par18">A patient is considered infectious from onset of prodrome such as myalgia and fatigue until all skin lesions have dried, scabbed over, and epithelized. At this point, the patient can be de-isolated and is no longer considered infectious. Unlike with SARS-CoV-2 transmission, presymptomatic or asymptomatic transmission has not been observed in traditional mpox. Nevertheless, with the current global outbreak, it is still not clear if transmission occurs among asymptomatic individuals i.e., those without any systemic symptoms and skin or rectal/genital lesions. Indeed, one study from France found that 6.5% of initially asymptomatic MSM on pre-exposure prophylaxis for HIV tested positive for the mpox virus.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup></p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Course and severity of infection</title><p id="Par19">Traditionally, the mpox virus has an incubation period of five to twenty-one days and presents with an initial fever. The prodromal febrile episode can last one to three days and can be associated with headache, malaise, myalgia, and lymphadenopathy. This is followed by an eruption stage of two to four weeks with heralding skin lesions that start as macules which&#x000a0;then transform into papules, which then form vesicles before evolving into pustules. The rash subsequently dries and crusts, forming scabs before healing over the following few weeks.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup></p><p id="Par20">Mpox is generally self-limiting.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup> Nonetheless, more severe disease and complications like bronchopneumonia, sepsis, encephalitis, and keratitis can occur in children, or in immunocompromised individuals.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup> Complications such as severe congenital infection can also occur in pregnant women.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup> Therefore, parturients, children, and the immunocompromised may experience increased morbidity and mortality.</p><p id="Par21">Whereas the 2017 Nigerian outbreak of Clade II resulted in about 3% deaths, the case fatality rate for the current Clade IIb global outbreak is considered to be &#x0003c; 1%. As of 15 November 2022, there have been 50 reported deaths (in 2022 alone).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup> What makes the current mpox outbreak more difficult to recognize is the atypical presentation: genital lesions and/or perianal lesions and proctitis (as opposed to the classical facial and limb vesicles).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup> In addition, genital lesions may occur before prodromal symptoms, and some patients do not have a fever or disseminated rash. In traditional mpox, the rash is synchronous, i.e., all in the same stage at the same time, unlike chicken pox. In the 2022 outbreak, the rash was asynchronous.</p><p id="Par22">Given the atypical presentations of the current mpox disease and increased transmissibility of the virus, there is a need for greater awareness and a higher index of suspicion for mpox in anyone presenting to the hospital with atypical features or rash. Consequently, robust infection control measures need to be taken in cases requiring anesthesia and surgery. There is currently a lack of clear or established recommendations on managing surgical patients who have suspected or confirmed mpox infection.</p><p id="Par23">We recommend isolation and tight infection control in suspected or confirmed mpox cases presenting for surgery. Clinicians should maintain a high index of suspicion for mpox infection in anyone with lymphadenopathy and a vesicopustular rash or anogenital legions, even without epidemiologic links. Diagnosis should be confirmed using polymerase chain reaction testing for orthopoxvirus DNA in skin lesions if available, and/or throat swab/upper respiratory (combined throat and nasal) swabs/rectal swabs.</p><p id="Par24">Other differential diagnoses to consider include varicella, herpes simplex, syphilis, hand foot and mouth disease, disseminated gonococcus infection, molluscum contagiosum, dengue, eczema, and any allergic reaction. If confined to the anogenital region, then chancroid, lymphogranuloma venereum, and HSV-2 are in the differential diagnosis.</p><p id="Par25">As a general rule, gloves should always be worn when examining a patient with an unknown rash.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>General health care recommendations</title><p id="Par26">With the 2022 outbreak, multiple recommendations for health care settings from various infection control authorities including Infection Prevention and Control Canada, Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC),<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup> the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) (USA),<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup> and the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (Singapore)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup> have been released. We base our recommendations these authorities and adapt them to anesthesia-specific situations.</p><p id="Par27">In general, these national authorities recommend the strict use of PPE when interacting and caring for suspected or confirmed cases. Full gowns, gloves, eye protection, and an N95 respirator are recommended by all three committees listed above. Isolation of patients in single rooms is also a consistent recommendation.</p><p id="Par28">The recommendations made by the abovementioned authorities are largely similar and recognize the possible risk of transmission via lesional and bodily fluids, and also respiratory secretions. These recommendations are, however, largely general to a wide range of health care settings, including primary care and outpatient clinic settings. As such, certain peculiarities that are relevant to anesthesia practice may need to be considered, such as the higher propensity for AGPs, and the much closer exposure to respiratory secretions during airway manipulation.</p><p id="Par29">The general infection-control guidelines by these authorities have also dedicated sections on contact and case management, including isolation room and PPE recommendations. We have extrapolated these recommendations into the anesthesia and operating room (OR) contexts to take into account factors unique to the OR, with further details described below.</p><p id="Par30">Nonetheless, specific limitations including social, economic, and local practice may preclude certain recommendations. Local infection-control authorities should still be consulted and involved in the establishment of protocols to suit their respective local contexts.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Anesthesia and surgery for patients with mpox</title><p id="Par31">With the atypical presentation and wide reach of the current mpox outbreak, we recommend that, while in the hospital setting, suspected or confirmed cases should be warded in a single room with dedicated facilities and with droplet and contact precautions. This is to prevent inadvertent nosocomial transmission to other patients and to HCPs. If available, patients with confirmed mpox infection may be placed under negative pressure, airborne isolation. All HCPs interacting with the patient should don PPE, including a full gown, gloves, eye protection with goggles or face shields, and an N95 respirator or equivalent mask. These recommendations are consistent with the PHAC&#x02019;s and CDC&#x02019;s interim guidance on infection control for patients with suspected or confirmed mpox.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup> Ideally, staff at high risk of severe disease (e.g., pregnant or severely immunocompromised individuals) should not provide direct care for patients with confirmed mpox.</p><p id="Par32">With possible risk of transmission to HCPs and other patients, or progression to more severe disease, nonurgent surgeries and procedures should be postponed until the patient is deemed noninfectious and/or deisolated. If the surgery is nonurgent or elective, the patient can be discharged for home isolation if deemed safe. The patient can be readmitted for surgery after documentation of recovery from mpox. This can help minimize transmission to HCPs and other inpatients, and save hospital bed resources.</p><p id="Par33">Nevertheless, if the surgery is emergent or essential, full precautions must be observed perioperatively. During transfer from isolation to the OR, the patient should wear a surgical mask, and skin lesions should be covered with a clean sheet or gown. The HCPs accompanying the patient should wear full PPE as described above, with a dedicated cleared route, when possible, to minimize lateral exposure. The receiving OR should ideally be negative or neutral pressure, and HCPs should wear full PPE. The patient should also be extubated and recover in the OR, observed as necessary, and then transported back to the isolation room.</p><p id="Par34">While the primary route of respiratory transmission is due to droplets and not airborne spread, we believe it is prudent for surgeries and anesthesia to be performed in a negative pressure or minimal neutral pressure OR when available, as there is a risk of spread of oral secretions and droplets during AGPs such as bag-mask ventilation, laryngeal mask airway insertion, endotracheal intubation, and extubation. This should be considered whenever possible, as there may be immunocompromised or pregnant patients within the OR complex who may be susceptible to higher morbidity than healthier individuals in the case of inadvertent transmission via possible airborne routes. This is also supported by CDC recommendations.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup> Aerosol-generating procedures should be done with the door closed and with minimal HCPs present. If negative pressure rooms are not available the high air exchanges in the OR should be sufficient since the patient is intubated and all staff are wearing N95 masks and full PPE. Procedures can be done under regional anesthesia or sedation to minimize AGPs.

As long as an avenue is provided for the HCP to seek further clarification and help, self-monitoring even for those with very low risks can serve as a safety net for mitigating further virus transmission. Those who are asymptomatic, with low to middle exposure risks, can continue to work. The presence of any symptoms suggestive of mpox should prompt self-isolation and immediate notification to their hospital infectious diseases (ID) and epidemiologic teams for further follow-up and treatment. Those with high-risk exposures but are asymptomatic should follow up with their local infection control team and self-monitor their symptoms closely. Guidelines generally allow such HCPs to continue working, but PEP is strongly recommended for these individuals.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup> Isolation may still be considered for these high-risk exposure HCPs so as to limit possible inadvertent nosocomial transmission or spread through the hospital setting.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Antivirals and their implications for anesthesia</title><p id="Par41">Treatment of mpox with antivirals is usually reserved for patients with severe disease, such as young children, pregnant women, or immunocompromised patients, or those with significant comorbidities. Most patients recover without significant sequelae, within two to four weeks without any medical treatment. An ID specialist should be involved in the diagnosis and management of a patient with suspected mpox, and in the decision to start antiviral treatment.</p><p id="Par42">If antiviral treatment is indicated, the antiviral of choice is tecovirimat (brand name: TPOXX<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> [SIGA Technologies, Inc., New York, NY, USA]) because of its favorable side effect profile. It has both intravenous and oral formulations. Tecovirimat inhibits a vital protein structure for viral proliferation and is generally well-tolerated in humans. The most common adverse reactions (&#x0003e; 10%) include pain on injection and headache. Uncommon side effects (1&#x02013;5%) include anemia, nausea, and vomiting. There are no known significant interactions with commonly used anesthetic drugs (including intravenous anesthetic agents, opioids, muscle relaxants, local anesthetics, volatiles, and reversal agents). Nevertheless, it appears to reduce effectiveness of midazolam, a commonly used anxiolytic anesthetic premedication. It also does not have any significant organ toxicity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup></p><p id="Par43">Intravenous cidofovir is a DNA polymerase inhibitor used for cytomegalovirus infection but has shown <italic>in vitro</italic> activity against the mpox virus. It has significant nephrotoxicity, and renal function should be monitored when using this drug. Adequate hydration and avoidance of other nephrotoxic drugs are recommended to reduce the risk of kidney injury.</p><p id="Par44">Oral brincidofovir, a lipid conjugate prodrug of cidofovir with good oral bioavailability, is less nephrotoxic but has more drug-drug interactions and a higher incidence of hepatotoxicity. There is a lack of data on its effectiveness in treating the mpox virus, though it shows <italic>in vitro</italic> effectiveness against other orthopoxviruses. It is a substrate of the organic anion transporting polypeptide (OATP) 1B1/1B3 and is an inhibitor of multidrug resistance-associated protein 2 and can interact with commonly used anesthetic drugs like nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and steroids. Monitoring of liver enzymes prior to anesthesia can help guide the dose adjustment of drugs with significant hepatic clearance (e.g., aminosteroid class muscle relaxant, paracetamol). Cidofovir or brincidofovir can be considered for severe mpox cases if tecovirimat is not readily available, but real-world data are still lacking.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup></p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Post-exposure prophylaxis</title><p id="Par45">Post-exposure prophylaxis can be considered for patients and staff with high-risk exposures (Table). These are individuals who have had significant or unprotected exposure to mpox patients and their lesions. Local public health authorities should be consulted with respect to PEP options and their availability. Patients and staff will need to be counseled on risks and benefits of vaccination depending on the exposure risk, their own comorbidities, and the type of vaccine available.</p><p id="Par46">Patients with high-risk exposure are recommended to undergo vaccination with the modified vaccinia Ankara (MVA) vaccine (brand names: IMVANEX<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> in the EU, IMVAMUNE<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> in Canada, and JYNNEOS<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> in the USA [Bavarian Nordic A/S; Hellerup, Denmark]), which is a replication-deficient attenuated vaccine against both smallpox and mpox. A full course requires two subcutaneous injections four weeks apart although a recent (at the time of writing, non-peer-reviewed) study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup> has evaluated the vaccine efficacy of a single dose. Modified vaccinia Ankara vaccines have a more benign side effect profile compared with the ACAM2000 vaccine and can be given to immunocompromised persons aged 18 yr and above. The main limiting factor of the MVA vaccine is its availability. As of September 2022, the Canadian National Advisory Committee on Immunization (NACI) recommends a single dose of IMVAMUNE (MVA vaccine) administered subcutaneously as PEP. A second dose can be offered if the HCP continues to be exposed to mpox and if they were not previously vaccinated against smallpox.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup></p><p id="Par47">ACAM2000, with an estimated vaccine efficacy against mpox of 86%,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup> can also be used particularly if the MVA-BN<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> vaccine (Bavarian Nordic A/S) is unavailable. It is a single dose live vaccine that is administered percutaneously via skin prick by a bifurcated needle. Peak immunity is expected after four weeks of inoculation. Nevertheless, there are many contraindications and risks of serious adverse events such as myocarditis, so this vaccine should only be given with careful risk assessment by an ID expert and in consultation with the HCP or exposed patient before proceeding.</p><p id="Par48">Post-exposure prophylaxis with vaccination should be administered within four days of exposure for maximum benefit, although it can be considered up to 14 days after exposure to attenuate the course of infection should it occur. The efficacy of this strategy is still unknown but a large national study is underway in France.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup></p><p id="Par49">Local guidelines and individualized decisions on the likelihood of transmission should be sought for intermediate-risk exposure patients in determining the need for PEP.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Pre-exposure prophylaxis</title><p id="Par50">Pre-exposure prophylaxis with the abovementioned vaccinations has been recommended by several national agencies for HCPs with significant risk of exposure to mpox including staff: 1) working in mpox isolation facilities, 2) involved with environmental decontamination, and 3) working directly with the virus in a laboratory setting.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup></p><p id="Par51">There are no oral pre-exposure prophylaxis regimens available.</p><p id="Par52">With limited data on use of prophylaxis in the general HCP population and the low transmissibility with adequate PPE, pre-exposure prophylaxis is likely not required for HCPs in surgical and anesthesia settings.

Thus, HCPs, including anesthesiologists and surgeons, should be aware of the clinical presentation, epidemiology, and infection control risks and measures required to protect themselves, their staff, and other patients. These should be done in collaboration with local infection control experts and authorities whenever possible, to have a strong protocol for their hospital staff to follow.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Publisher's Note</bold></p><p>Springer Nature remains neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.</p></fn><fn><p>Chao Tong Teo and Jiawei Sean Wu are joint co-first authors and contributed equally to this manuscript.</p></fn><fn><p>Jyoti Somani and Will Loh are joint co-senior authors and advised equally on this manuscript.</p></fn></fn-group><ack><sec id="d32e796"><title>Author contributions</title><p id="Par54"><italic>Chao Tong Teo</italic> and <italic>Jiawei Sean Wu</italic> contributed to all aspects of the manuscript, including conception, literature research, consolidation of information, and drafting of the article. <italic>Will Loh</italic> and <italic>Jyoti Somani</italic> contributed to the conception, design, and editing of the draft manuscript. <italic>Karen Chan</italic> and <italic>Su Wei Bryan Ng</italic> contributed to the drafting of the manuscript.</p></sec><sec id="d32e818" sec-type="COI-statement"><title>Disclosures</title><p id="Par55">We have no disclosures to declare.</p></sec><sec id="d32e823"><title>Funding statement</title><p id="Par56">We had no additional funding for this manuscript.</p></sec><sec id="d32e828"><title>Editorial responsibility</title><p id="Par57">This submission was handled by Dr. Stephan K.
