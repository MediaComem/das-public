In this third year of pandemic response, society needs to focus on improved implementation of effective interventions to end the acute phase. Governments and health authorities have the necessary knowledge and tools in hand, in the form of vaccines, diagnostics, and therapeutics, but equitable availability of these tools remains a challenge globally.</p><p id="para30">Today's decisions and efforts will continue to affect the pandemic's overall health, social, and economic toll. According to Our World in Data, 700&#x02009;000 deaths were recorded as COVID-19 related between January and March, 2022, and only 14&#x000b7;5% of people in low-income countries have received at least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine. SARS-CoV-2 variants continue to emerge as trust between governments and their constituents is tested, rendering sustained implementation of broad community-based interventions challenging. In many communities, crucial non-COVID-19 health services are yet to be fully restored to pre-pandemic levels.</p><p id="para40">The emergency phase of the COVID-19 pandemic will eventually end, but when will be determined by collective actions. Likewise, what is learned and how society grows from this experience can still be influenced. The next pandemic need not catch the world so unprepared.</p><p id="para50">The extraordinary nature of this pandemic calls for extraordinary analyses at global, national, and organisational levels. Society must reflect on what has been learnt about ourselves, our communities, our governance, and our preparedness and response systems. SARS-CoV-2 has caused too much harm in terms of death, morbidity, careers, relationships, finances, plans, and dreams for us to fall short of rigorous and independent after-action appraisal of the pandemic response. Communities have a right to understand why and how the pandemic response unfolded the way it did and to be assured improvements will be made. National and global leaders must use the knowledge gained from this pandemic and its reviews to ensure more robust multidisciplinary governance and equitable health and public health systems going forward.</p><p id="para60">A fresh approach to global health security is needed as well as the development of better measures of preparedness, with a greater emphasis on collaboration and equity. We call for improved funding of partners to enhance both preparedness efforts and alert and rapid response capabilities at both national and international levels. Sustained financing for institutions is necessary to train future leaders and build a global response workforce that embraces multidisciplinary scientific and public health networks as a core component. Immediate operational response needs at the country and local levels must be supported with sufficient resources.</p><p id="para70">Since its inception in 2000, the Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network (GOARN) has grown to encompass 270 partners and has responded to almost every major national and international outbreak through deployment of more than 3500 experts to over 100 countries. Drawing from this experience, we offer recommendations in the appendix outlining important next steps at this stage of the COVID-19 pandemic that would enable communities to better mitigate the health and societal impacts of the next pandemic.</p><p id="para11">
