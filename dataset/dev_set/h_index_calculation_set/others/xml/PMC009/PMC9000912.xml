All but one SARS-CoV-2 infection was due to the omicron variant. Among patients with COVID-19, five required hospitalisation, four of whom received supplemental oxygen; all eight patients received therapeutic anti-SARS-Cov-2 monoclonal antibodies, three received dexamethasone, and one received anakinra. One patient died (<xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix p 7</xref>). Of the eight patients with PCR-confirmed COVID-19, seven did not receive prophylactic monoclonal antibodies. The patient who received tixagevimab and cilgavimab and developed COVID-19 had only mild disease and did not require admission to hospital. No serious adverse effects after administration of prophylactic SARS-CoV-2 monoclonal antibodies were reported. Of note, COVID-19 also occurred in one (4%) of the 27 patients who had adequate humoral responses after vaccination, and in one patient who was not screened for humoral response (<xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix p 9</xref>).</p><p id="para50">Our study showed that more than a third of severely immunocompromised patients with immune-mediated inflammatory diseases did not mount an adequate antibody response to SARS-CoV-2 vaccination, and pre-exposure administration of tixagevimab and cilgavimab was associated with a lower risk of COVID-19. All patients with immune-mediated inflammatory diseases who are receiving immunosuppressive drugs should be screened for humoral response to vaccination based on anti-S titres. The absence of anti-SARS-Cov-2 antibodies after full vaccination identifies patients who are at high risk and are eligible for anti-COVID-19 monoclonal antibody prophylaxis. Successful administration of anti-SARS-CoV-2 monoclonal antibodies requires accurate identification of high-risk patients, rapid assessment of humoral responses to vaccination based on anti-S titres, and an easily accessible site for anti-SARS-CoV-2 monoclonal antibody administration.</p><p id="para60">The rate of COVID-19 was surprisingly high in our patients with immune-mediated inflammatory diseases who did not receive anti-SARS-CoV-2 monoclonal antibodies. A likely explanation for this is that patients in our cohort were highly exposed to SARS-CoV-2 during the omicron spread that occurred in France during the fifth wave of COVID-19 in January, 2022 (<xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix p 10</xref>).<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr"><sup>8</sup></xref> The onset of a highly contagious variant that was spreading rapidly across the country and was dominant at the time of this study, along with the absence of adequate humoral response to vaccination, might explain the high infection rate. We did not observe differences in age, gender, immunosuppressive therapy, comorbidity, vaccine type, or timing of vaccinations between patients who received or did not receive anti-SARS-CoV-2 monoclonal antibodies (<xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix pp 3&#x02013;6</xref>). The median time from infusion to last follow-up (50 days, IQR 43&#x02013;54) in the treatment group was longer than the time from humoral screening to development of COVID-19 (16&#x000b7;5 days, 5&#x02013;22) in the control (untreated) group, suggesting that patients in both groups have had approximately the same exposure to SARS-CoV-2 (<xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix pp 5&#x02013;6</xref>). Conversely, the decrease in the incidence of COVID-19 observed over time (<xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix p 10</xref>) might also have artificially inflated the benefit of prophylactic anti-SARS-CoV-2 monoclonal antibodies. It is also possible that patients who did not receive prophylactic antibodies were infected with SARS-CoV-2 before they were able to be treated. Although we have no evidence that our patients were in close contact with individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2, we cannot rule out the possibility that prophylactic treatment might have been given to patients after virus exposure. Three of the eight patients who developed COVID-19 were living in nursing homes and thus were at a higher risk of exposure to SARS-CoV-2. The threshold used to determine an adequate humoral response (264 BAU/mL) was consistent with a previously published study,<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr"><sup>9</sup></xref> and we observed a strong correlation between anti-S IgG titres and pseudoneutralisation activity (<xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix p 11</xref>).</p><p id="para70">Our study had several limitations. The anti-S titres in response to vaccine were not available for all patients, but the characteristics of patients deemed eligible for pre-exposure monoclonal antibody therapy were not different from those who were not screened for vaccine response (<xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix p 8</xref>). The sample size was small, and the study was done at a single centre. The findings of this study should thus be interpreted with caution, and future studies with larger sample sizes and more homogeneous follow-up times for treatment and control groups are necessary to confirm these results. Despite these limitations, our study is, to our knowledge, the first to report on the real-world clinical use of prophylactic anti-SARS-CoV-2 monoclonal antibodies in patients with immune-mediated inflammatory diseases, with initial evidence for clinical benefit.</p><p id="para80">In conclusion, our findings support the use of timely pre-exposure administration of prophylactic anti-SARS-CoV-2 monoclonal antibodies to prevent COVID-19 in patients with immune-mediated inflammatory diseases who are severely immunocompromised and do not generate an adequate humoral response to vaccination. Because it is unclear which SARS-CoV-2 variants will become dominant over the next few months, the benefits of pre-exposure prophylaxis will need to be updated over time.</p><sec sec-type="COI-statement"><p id="para90">TG and KS designed the study, directed the project, and wrote the Comment.
