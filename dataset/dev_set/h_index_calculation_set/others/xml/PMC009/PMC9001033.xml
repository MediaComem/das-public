Assess patient satisfaction with telemedicine for outpatient palliative care</p><p>2. Quantify time and resources saved by telemedicine</p><p>3. Examine patient demographic data and how they correlate to patient satisfaction with telehealth for outpatient palliative care</p></sec><sec><title>Background</title><p>Current literature on telemedicine use for palliative medicine focuses primarily on the accessibility of virtual health platforms. Information about patients&#x02019; attitudes toward using this medium is limited. Telemedicine expansion during the COVID-19 pandemic provided an opportunity to fill this knowledge gap.</p></sec><sec><title>Aim Statement</title><p>The aim of this article is to appraise the value of telemedicine for palliative outpatient care and help guide policy regarding telehealth implementation and expansion.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>Data are presented from a cross-sectional qualitative survey conducted via telephone of 51 patients who participated in 199 telemedicine visits (mean 3.9 visits per patient) from March through December 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic. Appointments were for established patients at both a large academic palliative clinic and a safety-net, palliative clinic. Questions measured patient satisfaction with healthcare delivery modes, barriers to care, and technological preparedness.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p><italic>Primary:</italic> All patients (100%) were either &#x0201c;extremely&#x0201d; or &#x0201c;somewhat&#x0201d; satisfied with their symptom management conducted via telemedicine. A majority of patients (65%) preferred a hybrid model with both telemedicine and in-person visits, and 14% preferred all follow-up via telehealth. <italic>Secondary:</italic> Telemedicine appointments required less time, travel, and family resources. Combined wait and appointment time for virtual visits was less than 30 minutes for 74% of patients, compared with 65% of patients spending 1 hour or more on in-person clinic days. Over half (56%) of support persons missed work to attend visits. No difference in satisfaction was detected when data were stratified by English language proficiency, internet access, and education level.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions and Implications</title><p>Patient satisfaction with telemedicine for palliative symptom management was similar to that for in-person clinic visits. Study was limited by selection bias; 28.42% of patients had died, 40.53% were unreachable. A larger study is needed. Telemedicine is advantageous, and preliminary data support its use.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front></article>
