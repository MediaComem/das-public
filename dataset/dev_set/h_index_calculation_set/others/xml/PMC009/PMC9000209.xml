Initial reports suggested the associated disease, COVID-19, produced rapid epidemic growth and caused high mortality. As the virus sparked local epidemics in new communities, health systems and policy makers were forced to make decisions with limited information about the spread of the disease. We developed a compartmental model to project COVID-19 healthcare demands that combined information regarding SARS-CoV-2 transmission dynamics from international reports with local COVID-19 hospital census data to support response efforts in three metropolitan statistical areas in Texas, USA: Austin-Round Rock, Houston-The Woodlands-Sugar Land, and Beaumont-Port Arthur. Our model projects that strict stay-home orders and other social distancing measures could suppress the spread of the pandemic. Our capacity to provide rapid decision-support in response to emerging threats depends on access to data, validated modeling approaches, careful uncertainty quantification, and adequate computational resources.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group><funding-source>

Early estimates of rapid growth with three-day doubling times and high mortality rates painted a grim picture. Preliminary projections suggested that, without interventions, the healthcare infrastructure would be overwhelmed and COVID-19 mortality might exceed 2 million deaths in the United States alone. Public health messaging initially focused on &#x0201c;flattening the curve&#x0201d; to reduce healthcare burdens and buy time to ramp up surveillance and develop effective response strategies.</p><p>Policymakers turned to mathematical models of disease transmission to help with interpreting data, projecting healthcare demands, and assessing mitigation measures. Over the last two decades, modeling has become a core tool for pandemic planning and decision support during emerging threats including the 2009 H1N1 flu pandemic, the 2015&#x02013;2016 Ebola epidemic, and the 2015&#x02013;2016 Zika virus pandemic.<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr"><sup>1</sup></xref> Such models are designed to synthesize information on disease progression and transmission dynamics with local epidemiological data to provide situational awareness, project future spread, hospitalizations, and mortality, and evaluate possible interventions.</p><p>Here, we describe key challenges in modeling early COVID-19 spread and strategies for constructing data-driven models in the face of uncertainty to provide situational awareness and pandemic projections for three Metropolitan areas in Texas.</p><sec><title>COVID-19 data and uncertainty</title><p>As the COVID-19 pandemic emerged in U.S. cities, there was great uncertainty regarding the transmission and severity of the virus. Two categories of data are required for robust modeling: 1) disease transmission and severity data, including the impact of behaviors that reduce transmission, and 2) surveillance data.</p><sec id="sec1a"><title>Disease Transmission and Severity Data</title><p>Pathogen natural history data describe mode of transmission, transmission rates, length of incubation or latent periods, timing and duration of symptom onset, and fatality rates. These data are typically aggregated from published studies, which are scarce for new pathogens. Given the speed in which COVID-19 was spreading, many groups chose to publish initial reports on <italic>medRxiv</italic> instead of waiting to disseminate following peer review.</p><p>Despite the quick response by the scientific community to share results and data, uncertainty in these key aspects of SARS-CoV-2 natural history remained. For example, early reports suggested individuals without symptoms were infectious. But it still remains unclear what fraction of infections is transmitted by these asymptomatic individuals. There is still debate on whether these cases would be more accurately described as subclinical, and how many asymptomatic cases are in fact presymptomatic and eventually progress to symptom onset.<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr"><sup>2</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr"><sup>3</sup></xref></p><p>These uncertainties are very important for modeling efforts. Many models are designed to capture uncertainties in these estimates when enough research is available to derive estimates of parameter distributions. This is not always possible, and in many cases knowledge from similar pathogens is used to fill in the gaps. Many modeling groups, including our own, borrowed from a rich history of influenza modeling to make reasonable assumptions about aspects of SARS-CoV-2 natural history that were not yet fully described in the literature.</p></sec><sec id="sec1b"><title>Surveillance Data</title><p>Disease surveillance systems typically track suspected and laboratory confirmed infection case counts and deaths. As SARS-CoV-2 spread, local, state, and federal agencies realized that hospitals may approach their patient capacities, and rapidly developed additional surveillance systems to track hospital census.<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr"><sup>4</sup></xref></p><p>Laboratory confirmation for SARS-CoV-2 infection required the development of novel diagnostics. Early delays in the manufacturing and distribution of testing kits hampered efforts to track the early spread of the virus. As testing ramped up, the demand caused backlogs in testing laboratories and exacerbated reporting delays. While many of these hurdles have been addressed, testing data remain an unreliable indicator of local transmission given the considerable spatiotemporal variability in testing availability and priorities and the high proportion of asymptomatic and mildly symptomatic cases.<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr"><sup>5</sup></xref><sup>&#x02013;</sup><xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr"><sup>7</sup></xref></p><p>Mortality data paint a more complete but time-lagged picture of severe COVID-19 prevalence.

Early attempts to project the course of the pandemic relied on estimates from other respiratory viruses and from initial reports from China.

The model tracks the changing number of individuals in distinct disease compartments. Newly infected individuals move from susceptible (S) to exposed (i.e., infected but not yet symptomatic or infectious) (E), followed by an infectious period that could be symptomatic (I<sup>Y</sup>) or asymptomatic (I<sup>A</sup>). Asymptomatic individuals recover (R) without ever developing symptoms. Symptomatic individuals could either become hospitalized (I<sup>H</sup>) or recovered (R). Hospitalized individuals then recover (R) or die (D). The population is divided into five age classes (0&#x02013;4 yr, 5&#x02013;17 yr, 18&#x02013;49 yr, 50&#x02013;65 yr, and +65 yr) and transmission is governed by age specific contact rates for home, school, work, and other locations. The model assumes that there is no travel in or out of each MSA, given the COVID-19 stay-home orders at the time of analysis. The full list of parameters is provided in the Table A1 in Appendix and in our reports.<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr"><sup>5</sup></xref><sup>&#x02013;</sup><xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr"><sup>7</sup></xref>

To address the missing early data, we assumed that the early transmission rate in Houston and Beaumont was identical to that estimated for Austin. These two reports took 8&#x02013;9 days to complete.</p></sec><sec id="sec3a"><title>Estimation of Epidemic Emergence Date and Impact of Stay-Home Orders</title><p>For Austin, we estimated initial transmission rate (<bold><italic>&#x003b2;</italic></bold><sub>0</sub>) and impact of stay-home orders (<bold><italic>&#x003ba;</italic></bold>) using nonlinear least squares fitting. For Houston and Beaumont, we estimated the date of epidemic emergence and <bold><italic>&#x003ba;</italic></bold> using a combination of nonlinear least squares fitting and a search across possible start dates. We estimated that COVID-19 began spreading in Austin, Houston, and Beaumont on February 15, February 10, and February 27, 2020, respectively. Furthermore, the local stay-home orders reduced COVID-19 transmission rates by 94% (95% CI: 55&#x02013;100%) in Austin, by 99% (95% CI: 80&#x02013;100%) in Houston, and by 85% (95% CI: 70&#x02013;100%) in Beaumont (see <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>). We used stochastic simulations to indirectly derive confidence intervals for <bold><italic>&#x003ba;</italic></bold>, and applied two methods to restrict simulations to only those in which the epidemic eventually grew exponentially. In Austin, we filtered out all simulated outbreaks that died out after a few cases; in the other areas, we initialized our simulations using a deterministic model that did not allow for stochastic fade out. The first method produced larger confidence intervals than the second method (see <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>).

</p></sec><sec id="sec3c"><title>Issue With Uncertainty Quantification</title><p>Our stochastic simulations of COVID-19 transmission in Austin produced two types of outcomes. Roughly 90% resulted in epidemic trajectories that mirrored the reported hospitalizations; the remaining 10% produced outbreaks that faded out before the epidemic began growing exponentially. This resulted in wide prediction intervals that do not fully convey the bimodal nature of the variation [see <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>(A)]. The narrower prediction intervals for Houston and Beaumont relative to Austin stem from a change in our methodology [<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figures 3</xref>(B) and (C)]. We employed a deterministic version of the model until there were at least ten daily incident cases and then switched to a stochastic version to ensure that all simulations progress to the point of wide community spread.</p></sec><sec id="sec3d"><title>Computational Resource Utilization</title><p>We utilized TACC's Frontera Supercomputer for all computations.

Through these efforts, the research team has had unprecedented access to comprehensive daily COVID-19 hospitalization data starting from the first reported case on March 13, 2020.</p><p>Data for Houston and Beaumont were provided by the Southeast Texas Regional Advisory Council (SETRAC), which helps to coordinate emergency healthcare responses across the Texas Gulf Coast, an area that includes Houston and Beaumont and is prone to hurricanes and flooding. SETRAC quickly pivoted its data sharing infrastructure to collect and disseminate COVID-19 hospitalization data. However, comprehensive COVID-19 hospital reporting was not required until April 2020. Thus, earlier data for estimating baseline transmission rates in March 2020 were not available for these two regions.</p><p>Throughout the pandemic, our unique partnership with healthcare systems in Austin has provided critical data for forecasting the pandemic and providing actionable decision support.<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr"><sup>9</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr"><sup>11</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr"><sup>12</sup></xref> Although our models are scalable to other cities and states, lack of access to granular, standardized, and reliably reported COVID-19 hospitalization data has been a major impediment to such efforts.</p></sec><sec><title>Modeling Infrastructure</title><p>We define modeling infrastructure broadly as a combination of expert knowledge, established methods and models (including software), and a data pipeline for model inputs. In March 2020, researchers at the University of Texas at Austin partnered with Texas Advanced Computing Center to establish the UT COVID-19 Modeling Consortium which brought these complementary needs under one roof. The consortium includes experts across diverse fields, including infectious disease modeling, optimization, statistics, social sciences, and software development. Moreover, many of its members have a long track record of collaborating on translational research bringing epidemic science and data to the frontline of public health.</p><p>The rapid pivot from influenza modeling to COVID-19 modeling was made possible by key similarities between the two viruses. First, influenza and SARS-CoV-2 are spread by similar types of contacts and have similar risk factors.<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr"><sup>3</sup></xref> This similarity allowed us to make use of the age-specific contact matrices and risk structures that we had previously developed for influenza modeling. Second, both viruses have latent periods and can be described by similar compartmental model frameworks. Given these similarities, we were able to adapt the influenza model for COVID-19 by altering the values of key parameters describing the disease progression and transmission dynamics of SARS-CoV-2. New data have since shown more differences between these two viruses, and we have been able to incorporate these updates quickly through software modifications.</p></sec><sec><title>Uncertainty Quantification</title><p>Reliable uncertainty quantification is crucial to accurately communicating plausible outcomes to the public and to policy makers. We incorporate uncertainty directly with our stochastic simulations, where some parameters are drawn from distributions and where transitions between disease states have a random component. The result of these stochastic simulations is an array of possible epidemic trajectories that capture plausible outcomes for a given parameter set. We found that our methodology for initializing epidemic simulations produced too many unrealistic simulations and inflated our uncertainty in projecting hospitalizations, even after the most unrealistic simulations were removed. We updated our simulation initialization methodology to produce more realistic simulations, and we believe these results to better capture the realistic uncertainty in our model projections. In our full reports, we also explore multiple possible transmission rate reduction scenarios both inside and outside of our estimated confidence bounds to highlight the dependence of future trajectories on individual behavior and intervention policies.<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr"><sup>5</sup></xref><sup>&#x02013;</sup><xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr"><sup>7</sup></xref></p></sec><sec><title>Computational Resources</title><p>We made extensive use of TACC's Frontera supercomputer for both model development and analysis. Once our workflow was optimized, we were able to produce the approximately 2000 simulations needed for each report in under one hour by taking advantage of the highly parallel processing capabilities of Frontera CPU nodes. This resource coupled with the real-time multifaceted support of TACC staff allowed us to complete the analysis and reports within four to nine days of data receipt. Computational resources were never a limiting factor.</p><p>In the months since the release of these three reports, pandemic policies, human behavior, and, consequently, the pandemic itself have evolved. We have updated our models continually to reflect our changing understanding of the situation, to make use of new data sources, and to support decision making at multiple scales, including the evaluation of stay-home orders, physical distancing recommendations, masking requirements, and testing priorities. Stemming from these early reports, we now maintain three dashboards that provide real-time COVID-19 situational awareness and short-term mortality and healthcare projections across Texas and the U.S.<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr"><sup>9</sup></xref> Our collaborative consortium and access to the world-class computational resources at TACC has enabled and accelerated our ability to provide actionable models for the public and decision-makers.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>Access to expertise, data, modeling infrastructure, and computational resources has enabled rapid and high impact modeling in support of front-line COVID-19 response efforts. Academic groups such as the UT COVID-19 Modeling Consortium can rapidly expand access to expertise, modeling infrastructure, and computational resources by leveraging collaborator networks and engaging with stakeholders. However, data access relies on external public health and clinical systems. These systems have been heavily stressed by the pandemic in ways that have impeded data collection and dissemination. While hospitalization data have proven to provide a robust signal for COVID-19 prediction models, these data are not consistently reported. This restricts the application of our most reliable prediction models to a selected set of cities that report hospitalization data; localities without access to hospitalization data may have reduced situational awareness. Now in the tenth month since the emergence of SARS-CoV-2, reporting of more traditional surveillance data including confirmed case and mortality data access are still often inconsistent and missing key context for interpretation (e.g., testing policies and test sensitivity and specificity).</p><p>In addition to advocating for continued investment in the basic and applied science resources that enable the work of UT COVID-19 Modeling Consortium, we also advocate for investment in public health systems that facilitate disease surveillance and case reporting. These systems include decision making frameworks to guide resource allocation and data collection policy during public health crises, infrastructure for data dissemination (e.g., data repositories), and trained personnel who can collect, aggregate, and disseminate not only surveillance data but the metadata that allow stakeholders to contextualize those data. Expanding these critical resources while solidifying connections between researchers, technologists, clinicians, emergency responders, and public health and governmental authorities will be essential to preventing and containing future pandemic threats.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGMENTS</title><p>The authors acknowledge three anonymous reviewers for their helpful reviews of this manuscript.
