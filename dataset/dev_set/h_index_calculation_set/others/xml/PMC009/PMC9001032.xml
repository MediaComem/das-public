When compared to the United States overall, providers working globally and in American Indian tribal nations may have experienced increased personal and professional suffering and distress due to the pandemic. The pandemic has also shone a light on inequity in healthcare and revealed how minority patients have been affected disproportionately. In response to travel and in-person gathering limitations, technology can be leveraged to enhance resiliency, decrease isolation, and mitigate burnout in providers, as well as provide a place to discuss these inequities and engage in communal grieving. These necessary adaptations during the global pandemic provided valuable lessons we can take forward in our practices. Our team leveraged Zoom and Project ECHO groups across countries and cultures, resulting in enhanced resiliency and bidirectional learning. We present our experiences and best-practices for leveraging technology to enhance resiliency across cultures using case studies of 3 different settings: Lakota Nation, the Caribbean, and Latin America.</p></abstract></article-meta></front></article>
