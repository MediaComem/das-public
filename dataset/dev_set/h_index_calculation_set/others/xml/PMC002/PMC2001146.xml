It has been argued that both cigarette consumption rates and smoking prevalence data are necessary to explain a tobacco epidemic, especially when using lung cancer death rate as an index of smoking-attributable mortality<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>. However, historical smoking history data, such as annual age and sex-specific cigarette consumption rates, are not available nationwide for many countries<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>. Also, it has been difficult to quantify the benefits of large scale, preventive interventions. Therefore, it is necessary to have alternative approaches to explaining the beneficial impacts of both recent and past tobacco control efforts.</p><p>Because 85% of male lung cancer deaths are attributed to tobacco smoking, any decline or deceleration in the observed lung cancer death rates could be attributed to anti-smoking interventions in the past<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>. Ireland does not have a comprehensive tobacco control program but pockets of tobacco control efforts were in place over the past 40 years or so. Lung cancer trends in young adults (30-39 years of age in particular) have been used as an early indicator of progress in tobacco control<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>, and therefore any observed decline among the youngest age-cohorts would indicate the beneficial impacts of more recent anti-smoking activities. In addition, the relative change in lung cancer mortality rates between successive time-periods would also signal the need for additional aggressive anti-smoking strategies. However, in Ireland, it is premature to use age-specific lung cancer death rates to monitor the early consequences of the nationwide workplace smoking ban that was only introduced in March 2004<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>.</p><p>This study estimates the annual-percent-changes in lung cancer mortality rates from 1958 to 2002 using the Joinpoint regression model (version 3.0) of the US National Cancer Institute's Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) program<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>, with special emphasis on the youngest age-cohorts (between 30 and 49 years of age). A simple age-cohort modelling was also performed to explain the temporal patterns.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>METHODS</title><p>Lung cancer mortality data from 1958 to 2002 were downloaded from the WHO Cancer Mortality Database<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>. Age-sex specific adjusted lung cancer death rates standardised to the World Population are also available from the WHO Cancer Mortality Database<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>. Age-specific population estimates for the periods studied were obtained from the Irish Central Statistics Office website (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="www.cso.ie"/>).</p><p>We looked at age-specific lung cancer death rates across the year of birth. In other words, a &#x02018;synthetic&#x02019; birth cohort for each age group was created based on the year and age of death of each individual, using 5-year age and 5-year calendar-period intervals. Each birth cohort could be identified by the central year in the interval. To look at trends across birth cohorts, we employed a simple age-cohort modelling technique. Log-linear Poisson regression modelling (with an offset) was employed to estimate the effects across each birth cohorts adjusting for age relative to the youngest cohorts for both sexes, using the GENMOD procedure in SAS software (version 8.0). However, the use of classical age-period-cohort (APC) modelling techniques could have improved the &#x0201c;fit&#x0201d; of the model (albeit at the expense of extra degrees of freedom), but the random variation associated with parameter estimates might lead to erratic predictions<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>. The classical APC models are also limited with the &#x0201c;non-identifiability&#x0201d; problem. In addition, lung cancer temporal studies consistently show an age-cohort phenomenon rather than an age-period phenomenon in several APC model studies.</p><p>For continuous changes in lung cancer death rates across different time-periods, log-linear Poisson regression models were used to calculate APC and joinpoint analyses has been extensively used recently for estimating such temporal effects<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>. Because the focus of this study is on younger age-cohorts, we employed jointpoint regression analyses for estimating temporality only for age-groups between 30 and 49 years. Fewer lung cancer deaths per year for each of these younger age-groups necessitated to collapse every 5-calendar year periods into an average age-standardised lung cancer death rate for each of the 5-year age-groups studied (30-34, 35-39, 40-44, 45-49 years of age).</p><p>In brief, the Joinpoint<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref> analysis fits a series of joined straight lines on a log scale to the age-specific and age-standardised lung cancer death rates. Line segments are joined at points called joinpoints. Each joinpoint denotes a statistically significant change in trend. In joinpoint analysis, the best-fitting points are the years of death that change significantly (increasing or decreasing trends). The analysis starts with the minimum number of joinpoints, and tests whether one or more joinpoints are statistically significant and should be added to the model. A maximum of three joinpoints can be added to the final model. Because of collapsed 5-year calendar periods from 1958 to 2002 and not using the single calendar year death rates for lung cancer trends, the joinpoint analysis could only test a maximum of two joinpoints for this particular study design.</p></sec><sec><title>RESULTS</title><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> shows the peaking of male lung cancer death rates in the late eighties and the beginning of stabilisation in female death rates when calendar periods were considered.

This is consistent with the recent lung cancer incidence pattern<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>, and also with the decreasing smoking prevalence in the relatively young adults<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>. The youngest birth cohorts not only had the lowest lung cancer risk but also showed significant decreasing rates in lung cancer death rates in most recent years. Such temporal patterns indicate the beneficial impacts of both the recent and the past anti-smoking interventions in Ireland. However, a slower relative decreasing rate among the youngest female age-cohorts identifies the need for additional and more aggressive tobacco control efforts targeting at specific population groups.</p><p>A recent study in Ireland reported a fall in teenage smoking prevalence from 20% in 1995 to 13% in 2003<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>. However it is too soon to estimate the effects on lung cancer rates of high teen smoking initiation for the decade before 1995. Non cancer health gains are also evident following the nationwide workplace smoking ban<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>. Therefore, further health and social gains are realistically achievable if target populations, especially women, lower socio-economic groups and the youngest adults, are empowered and provided an enabling environment.</p><p>For further gains from the ill-health effects of smoking, especially on the younger generations, an accelerated decline in smoking prevalence and an increase in smoking quitting rates are essential. The Irish government is committed to a Tobacco Free Society<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>. However, for a faster decline in lung cancer rates, a comprehensive tobacco control program similar to the State of California that showed a 6% decline in lung cancer incidence within a decade has to be enforced<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>. With similar programs in Massachusetts in 1993<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>, smoking prevalence in youths declined from 36% in 1995 to 30% in 1999 and from 17% in 1993 to 10% in 2000 in pregnant women<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>. Even smoking quit rates increased from 18% in 1993 to 26% in 2002<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>. In addition to smoke-free policies, both these states also exercised a regular increase in cigarette price. Evidence shows that a 10% increase in cigarette price can have a 4% decline in cigarette consumption rates and a 1-2% decrease in smoking prevalence in the developed world, particularly among youths<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>. Interestingly, a 10% increase in tax will also reduce lung cancer mortality rate by 1.2% in the first year<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>.</p><p>In conclusion, current lung cancer death rates in Ireland are encouraging but an accelerated further annual decline is also realistically achievable in both sexes, especially among the younger generations, if evidence-based policies are introduced. Youths are price-sensitive and a 10% increase in cigarette price would allow 40,000 Irish smokers to quit smoking<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>, and this would save thousands of productive life years lost due to tobacco-related premature deaths in Ireland. Future monitoring of the nationwide workplace smoking ban should assess trends in lung cancer death rates in young adults' once long-term lung cancer mortality data are available post ban.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The Royal City of Dublin Hospital (RCDH) Research Trust funded Dr Zubair Kabir (ZK) to undertake his PhD thesis in Trinity College Dublin.
