The book is ingeniously divided into subsections, with each theme elegantly presented.</p><p>It provides some basic facts in the provision of emergency vascular services and treatment outcomes in the UK, USA and Scandinavia. It also supplies the reader with knowledge on the pathophysiology of vascular conditions and the complications that may develop in the management of some of these conditions. The risk assessment and the medico-legal minefield involved in the management of these patients are also discussed.</p><p>The section on Acute Cerebrovascular Syndromes gives a good synopsis on acute ischaemic strokes and their management, in particular the timing and role of surgical intervention, a subject upon which many vascular surgeons are still hesitant. This section is followed by another well put together section on acute lower limb ischaemia and diabetic feet. This gives an excellent overview on surgical and endovascular options and the possible problems that may be associated with intervention. However, chapter 18, &#x0201c;Acute Ischaemia Secondary to Occult Prosthetic Graft Infection&#x0201d;, is just slightly difficult to read because of the many complex algorithms. Nonetheless, it covers an arduous subject commendably. The rest of the book embraces magnificently catastrophes, injuries and emergencies of the arteries and veins in the thorax, abdomen and peripheries. It provides the reader with wealth of information on the aetiology, pathophysiology and the various medical and conventional surgical options necessary for dealing with these conditions.</p><p>I have no doubt this book will be a valuable asset in any private or institutional library. The authors have managed to put together a book on the diverse emergency vascular conditions encountered by vascular clinicians, including some rare conditions which, although not typically seen in Northern Ireland, nonetheless have presented at our doorsteps, and will no doubt challenge our capabilities and resources at some stage in our careers. This is definitely a very good reference and guide book for vascular surgeons at all levels.</p></body></article>
